Some conditions didn't come up in med hx conversation that appeared in the GP report - Antiplatelet meds, B12 / anemia... Some medical info came up during small talk - splint and sleep apnea. I think this issue stems from lack of experience / practical knowledge...\\r\\nAlso had issues identifying / describing \\\"abnormalities\\\" that werent necessarily bad or signs of disease. i.e. discoulouration on the lips, or mucosa.\\r\\n\\r\\nOtherwise, I felt pretty confident about meeting patient and recording med hx. Very helpful that I reached out ahead of time and asked pt. to print and bring medical history from GP- considering patient more than likely had to do this plenty of times before with other specialty doctors, I got lucky that I was able to cross reference and receive a comprehensive list of all the medical conditions and current medication.\\r\\nAlso, considering the patient had issues with being fully reclined- I had to adapt and do intraoral exam standing up. This wasn't an issue as I feel like I adapted pretty well but it was definitely a learning experience. Overall- pt case was very complex and I think I managed it OK! I think it was satisfactory but I see how I can improve and do better for next time / next pt.\"\n",

This sessions, I really built on my communication skills with patients, and got my first real experience in a clinic. With regards to the intra-oral examination, I need to work on positioning my light to see things more clearly, as well positioning my mirror to an optimal position. I also really need to hone in on my infection control habits, as I made some mistakes during this session, so being mindful of what I am doing and holding is critical. I also am more comfortable with using titanium, and knowing how to format an 011, and also how to chart in an efficient manner. For next, session I hope to build on my communication skills and settle the nerves, and I also hope to be more time and practically efficient when it comes to completing the required procedures. Dr. Soosaipillai further gave great feedback on my charting of the maxillary arch, and I hope to utilize this feedback for the mandibular arch next session. \"\n",

Extra-oral and intra-oral examination generally went okay, but I could be quicker in my examinations. During probing I should be more mindful of my posture as I would bend my back when probing the posterior teeth.

Adding on I've improved on using my mirror on different angles to mimic the correct anatomy of the central incisor. But this is still something I need to further my development on. I did damage the same tooth on the facial aspect using the enhancer so I need to focus on not doing that. Adding on during the composite placement I should've removed the excess I had within the proximal contact as it took me a while to finish it.

Resto was acceptable but i was finding it very hard to blend in the composite from the main resto to the composite in the bevel. I need to work on that the most.

With restoration - the labial aspect was difficult to maintain smooth before finishing as I had poor angulation/control with the flat plastic.

Facial and labial surfaces polished nice, no voids. Contact still slightly present but would be gone if i continue to round that angle. Next time i need to make a better contact to avoid loosing it.

I need to make sure I do not use the patient\\u2019s lips for stability during injection as movement can move the needle. The biggest challenge today was clamp placement, where I had a lot of difficulty placing the clamp on the 46 especially on the lingual aspect as I was impinging on the gingiva and hurting the patient.

I mixed them up because I thought 27 gauge was the needle that pierces better for more fatty tissue but it\\u2019s the 30 gauge (mix up on my end) but will revise better next time. I was a bit nervous when inserting and this caused the positioning to be a little off from where I wanted it initially but was able to correct. I injected the LA at the correct slow speed, talked to my patient during the procedure, retracted tissues, checked for aspiration and checked to make sure topical anaesthesia worked. I put the needle down once after injecting so need to make habit of keep holding it. Dam also went well but did it on 45 instead of. 46 because of mix up last week but principles were there. Also with actual patient will inform about pre operative risks and provide post operative instruction\",\n",

You need to start checking/measuring and critical analysing your own work, having your perio probe on your tray is a good start. \\r\\nRemember it\\u2019s a simulation lab and you should be simulating infection control measures you would take in clinic - this means removing your gloves to collect consumables as Dr. Wylie reminded everyone at the start of the session. - reminded twice. \\r\\nBe mindful of direct overhead light on your non cured resin. \\r\\nExcess resin is great for these restorations to allow yourself room to polish and shape, however you have a bit too much excess making your job a lot harder.you did a good job of reducing this resin in the end. Specifically, you restored over the untouched distal corner resulting in a loss of your reference point. \\r\\nKeep remembering to check all angles as you picked up from the demonstration as this will really help when you are shaping the tooth but easily forgotten until the last minute. \\r\\nA void on the mesial margin. Unless you have adequate space to properly condense resin in this area, you need to open up these areas and re etch/bond and place more resin. As you noticed trying to push resin into a small space intrpox does not adequately fix the problem. \\r\\nMesial corner needs very slightly adjustment but nearly there. Palatal too thick but on the right track. Excess across labial and palatal margins that require further polishing however will more time, would be able to produce an adequate restoration (besides the void).

The resin placement was a lot smoother than last week as I focused on tapping the resin more than pushing it into place, however there was a lot of excess buccally and next time need to push this away with the gold instruments. Also did the prep and resto on 21 which is completely my fault next time will ensure to work on the correct tooth.  Furthermore, the bevel was angled too steeply due to incorrect burr position, next time will come in from a lower angle from the palatal side. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn terms of the restoration, the shape of the restoration was good, the contact area was re-established and there was adequate thickness and anatomy of the incisal edge as it was in line with adjacent tooth and was not too bulky or thin. However the main problem was excess. There was both palatal and labial excess which caused the finishing to be harder which led to some enamel damage labially. Next time this needs to be fixed during the placing stage whereby rein will be scooped out at teh margins rather than losing sight of where the margins of the restoration are.\"\n",

When adapting anatomy, I was a bit deficient mesio-palatally and due to the tooth inserted at a twisted angle, it was hard to tell when I was in excess labially or palatally as the tooth normally protrudes anyways, however, this was a useful learning opportunity as I will being seeing all types of dentitions in practice.  \\r\\nDr. Wylie gave great tips on how to improve my restoration and also my polishing. Although this sessions came with some struggle, I felt like I was getting the hang of it in the end and I am looking forward to progressing. \"\n",

Restoration could have been faster, as I took a lot of time placing composite, with difficulties having too much bulk on the palatal surface, but I should also be aware that I can remove bulk during finishing. There are also overhangs on the mesial edge because I did not pull hard enough on the matrix strip during curing. I should find time to complete finishing by reducing the bulk on the palatal surface and reducing the incisal edge, and polishing when I have time in future sessions.\"\n",

To be more time efficient, can apply the topical anaesthesia before you assemble the syringe. Ensure that you check that the needle/cartridge is engaged and that the flow rate is adequate. Can ask the patient if you can lean on their shoulder during administering the LA, and can troubleshoot hitting bone too early by pulling the needle out slightly, rotating the needle more posteriorly and then going deeper into the tissue until you hit bone (then retreat slightly)\",\n",

The matrix band set-up although burnished, did not result in a strong contact with the adjacent tooth. Contact was still present but the demonstrator noted that it could be improved. Moreover, due to not having my yellow light filter installed on my loupes as well as general incompetence in using a mirror, I spent too long molding my resin composite and that resulted in porosities. During my next restoration, my next steps will be to work with the resin composite with higher competence to introduce less porosities. Moreover, I will burnish the matrix more and ensure a better contact point. \"\n",

I also did make sure to keep moving the burr the whole time. However after the plaque removal the prophy cup was shredded a little bit indicating there was some regions I used too much pressure (especially interproximally in the molars) so next time this needs to be more gentle. Although I worked systematically I struggled to clean the distal surfaces of the 17,27,37,47. However with better retraction I was able to reach it eventually. As for the fulcrum I did have a stable fulcrum most of the time but in harder to reach surfaces found it difficult to find hard tissue to stabilise on but next time need to be more active about it \"\n",

The prep was also over-extended distally as trying to chase distal caries the prep suffered due to excessive depth. There was also some roughness on the gingival margin. Selective caries removal was performed as soft caries was left on top of the pulpal wall and mesio-axial wall. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn terms of the cusp reduction. The depth grooves were adequate bucco-lingually, but then upon changing planes it was hard to find an adequate finger rest causing there to be not enough reduction approximally (this was fixed later). However distally the depth grooves were too far distal and hence in this region the depth was not enough due to inaccurate burr positioning.

With regards to my cavity prep, I underestimated the extent of the caries distally, so I ended up removing too much caries towards the distal aspect, for the future, I should prioritize making an outline to ensure full extent of caries is reached. There was also a tiny spot of DEJ caries left mesio-palatally, so I should be mindful of that. In terms of my dam, I need to ensure to fully stretch the dam over the frame. Overall, on time I only finished the MO prep, thus, I could be more mindful of how quick I am going, to ensure all required procedural steps for the day are complete. Overall a very informative session, and fantastic help and feedback from Dr. Wylie (especially with tip to use the highspeed to get rid of the caries along the mesial-palatal DEJ).  \"\n",

Dr. Tyas had pointed out that it is better to place the clamp on the tooth next to the whichever tooth that would be worked on.\\r\\n- 16 cavity prep was conservative. Successfully removed caries along the peripheral wall and DEJ and left caries on the axial wall and pulpal floor. I can improve on smoothing the cavity prep. Dr. Tyas suggested using the flat fissure burr gently around the cavity which improved the smoothness overall. No adjacent tooth damage.\\r\\n- Cuspal reduction was acceptable but has room for improvement. I think I was able to achieve the thickness but can improve on the smoothness. I will watch the videos again to better understand how to angulate my burr to achieve the optimal anatomical structure when reducing the cusp.\"\n",

Using the plaque gel was a little daunting at first, but with guidance and a prior debrief with our whole team helped streamline the process. Next, working with the prophy paste was a completely new experience that ran smoothly as well. Finding the right pressure for the slow speed was new at first but with practice and guidance it all worked out in the end. Overall, I think I need to improve on my confidence with the slow speed and how to smoothly angle it to maximise my efficiency in targeting areas of the tooth for plaque removal.

I found this difficult particularly around the lower incisors however something that helped me was continuously asking my patient for feedback, and asking whether I was retracting too forcefully or gently. This continuous feedback was useful throughout the process and I found I became significantly more comfortable retracing her cheeks towards the end of the procedure. \\r\\n\\r\\nI also found it useful experimenting whether it was more effective to ask the patient to rinse, or simply use suction after applying the disclosing gel. After some trial and error as well as feedback from Dr Van, I found that using suction alone provided the most information as asking the patient to rinse led to too much of the disclosing gel disappearing. \\r\\n\\r\\nSomething I am proud of today is my time management. I ensured that I tracked the time I was spending on each procedure, ensuring I factored in time for my demo to come around and check my work. This was particularly useful as it allowed my partner to have enough time to clean up the bay after the procedures were done. For my future sessions, I will aim to continue managing my time effectively to ensure I am abke to make the most out of my GP sessions.\"\n",
