Had difficulty being stable while using the elevators, need to ensure to have a finger rest. I tried to elevate the root however it wasn't coming out. The demo stepped in and showed me the correct technique and how more pressure was required. Really interesting to see the difference between the amount of force required whilst extracting a real root compared to plastic teeth. Next time I will definitely utilise these tips \n",

GIC would adhere better to the tooth structure. Learnt about Equia and how it is the strongest GIC. Also really interesting to see the presentation of the caries on the hyper plastic tooth. The caries was not how we would normally expect it. \n",

Pt was very scared of LA so my demonstrator took over and injected LA instead as we might only have one go at LA injection for this pt. During the exo process, my demonstrator has helped to guide me through this. My demonstrator pointed out how I did not use my elevator correctly as I tend to rest the elevator on the lip which I shouldn't have and instead rest it on the tooth, after observing my demo, I was able to do it. When using the forceps, it was very hard for me to extract this tooth as it has quite long roots and it took me a lot of efforts to extract it. However, my demo has guided me through the process and I learnt that during exo, I should extend my movements bigger so that the PDL can be broken through as this tooth was not mobile but cavitated instead. Took quite some time but I got there at the end. Very stressful but I think I'll be able to do it better next time. \n",

It was so surprising to learn that only four students are accepted very year though I learnt that you have to be a general dentist for 2 years before applying for this course. I was fortunate to observe a clinician today who saw three patients: one who had a temporary anchorage device (TAD) screwed into their hard palate and two who had their wires/bands changed. I learnt that bands generally do not have a functional aspect and are purely for aesthetics, however there are also some bands that help to hold the wire in place or close the gap between the teeth (power chains). It was very interesting!\n",

      "SO Feedback: I volunteered to assist for a general dentist this morning for three different appointments involving a debridement, emergency abscess appointment and occlusal restoration. The first thing I noticed was that she was very time efficient while still being precise and accurate. She was very lovely and explained all the steps to me and her rationale behind certain procedures/decisions. I learnt how to rule out different endodontic diagnoses (ie. radiolucency at the apex of the tooth is likely indicative of apical periodontitis however there was no TTP meaning that this diagnosis is ruled out, etc) and about partial necrosis, which can occur when a tooth has accessory canals that are still vital- this would explain the positive cold test. During the restoration appointment, I also tried to ensure that everything was prepared and ready for the dentist to increase procedural speed as it was a very full on morning. \n",

Although I was able to identify that some of his teeth were not in occlusion, I did not know that it was called a scissor bite- might be a good idea to review my occlusion notes (including cross bites, etc).

      "Student Reflection: First Day at the La Trobe Community Health Services in MOE, I saw 1 patient at the end of the day who was booked in for an exam. Because we ran over time with the first patient, I ended up starting late with my patient. I saw a Paediatric pt aged 13. They came in assuming it was for a clean instead of checkup. After consulting with my supervisor, we decided to do a limited exam and debride the pt as it was their goal for the appt. The exam went fairly smooth, the pt had braces with a coiled spring as the pt was missing their 13 which couldn't grow out due to the crowding they had previously (mentioned by pt). It was difficult for me to debride the pt because of the braces getting in the way and due to the pt's heightened sensitivity. I did my best with the EMS and talking to the pt to get them to relax a bit more.\n",
      "Improvements: At the start of the appt, I did not look through the pt history thoroughly because I didn't check if they had past Radiographs for not (they didn't). Had I checked through this beforehand, it would have saved some time and allowed me to finish the appt a little bit earlier. This was my first time using Titanium Unity so I struggled a little with the new system, I will practice this more as I go through the rotation and hopefully improve.\n",

      "Student Reflection: 1st pt of the morning came in for a FM debridement. I did the debridement using EMS and sickle scaler. The EMS was slightly wider than what I was used to so it was slightly difficult to adjust to it. I did the clean but was slightly behind on time as I didn't have enough time to complete a Prophy on the pt. This was my second time doing a debridement on a paediatric pt outside of smilesquad and using an EMS on them. I left quite a bit of calculus on their lower anteriors. I need to use the floss more to find all the excess calculus when I don't have access to an 11/12 explorer. There was also some plaque left on the buccal surfaces of the teeth in Q1. I will try my best to adapt the EMS to the tooth better to remove the plaque. If I had done Prophy it may have removed the plaque but sometimes not successfully so in the future I will need to examine the teeth better. I also think that I will need to do better with patient communication as the pt wasn't very receptive to what I said ie \"relax your tongue, open wider\". I will try to build more rapport in the future.\n",

      "Last pt of the day was a 4 yr old child who came in for their separators on the 55M and the 65M. It was my first time trying to place separators on a person. Previously in SIM I had tried to place separators on plastic teeth but not succeeded as the bands would be out of shape by the end of it. However due to the patient being non-compliant and keeping their mouth closed/yelling/covering their face/kicking their legs up I was worried that I would hurt the pt so my supervisor stepped in to place the separators onto the pt instead. The child's mother helped hold the pt in place for separators to be placed in.\n",
      "For the future I need to make sure that I assess the pt's level of compliance before placing the separators on. A pt that isn't compliant may need to be seen by more experienced dental clinicians\n",
      "My support operator was very helpful in this appt. Because the pt was not very compliant I struggled to get them to open their mouth, however, they asked if the pt wanted to count their teeth and held the mirror up into their mouth. This was a good distraction strategy as the pt opened their mouth to let us 'count' their teeth. While I still wasn't able to place the separator in, this is a good technique that I will try to use in the future to distract the pt so that I can perform the necessary tx.\n",

I helped get the box of SSC with different teeth and sizes. I learnt that aside from the 3M SSC sizes the clinic also offered the HuFriedy SSC sizes which are a little bit more narrow from mesial to distal. I also learnt that dentine conditioner isn't always necessary even if the pt is complaint. This made sense because we would be using the conditioner on the enamel surface which won't be that effective as it's not dentine.\n",

The appt went well and the exam and radiographs were taken smoothly. The main improvements I think I could have done in this appt was my rapport building. I definitely did a lot better with patient management today than yesterday. I spoke to the patient and got her to open up as she was very shy at the start of the appt, unwilling to speak or look me in the eye, but as the appt went on, I think she warmed up to me and started to feel a lot more comfortable (to the point she was actively moving around the dental chair). The pt did not want to use the triplex in their mouth even after being showed the instrument and having it demonstrated onto her mother. So to dry the teeth to get a better view, I used gauze as the pt tolerated it a lot better. \n",
      "When taking BWs for the pt, I was originally going to use a snapper ray however the pt did not like the feeling of a really bulky item in her mouth and refused to comply. I managed to convince the pt to take the radiographs when I switched to using wingtabs on the film instead and informing her that I would give her 2 big stickers if she sat still and allowed me to 'take a picture' of her teeth. \n",
      "Overall I think I did a lot better with pt management and rapport building but I could definitely do a lot better next time and hopefully even convince the paeds pts to use triplex if they are nervous and/or scared about it.\n",

      "Student Reflection: First pt of the day was a 13yr child attending for an emergency pt, they presented with a toothache on their upper right hand side. Upon examination I found that they had an over retained 53 with the 13 erupted buccally. The gingiva around the 13 was very inflamed and was the most likely cause of the pain they had when eating due to the lack of cleaning in that area. The diagnostic tests (TTP and TP) didn't show anything related to the apex of the 13 so it was decided that I would give the pt some OHI and extract the 53. Since the pt hadn't been to LCHS before, my supervisor also suggested for me to do a proper 011 before the extraction. I completed the exam and also took LHS and RHS BWs. The pt had a 71, I took a PA of the lower anteriors just to make sure that they did not have an unerupted 31 (they did not). All the radiographs were taken with a snapper-ray I was able to get a good radiograph of them which was nice.\n",
      "This was my first exo on a patient, I'm very thankful the pt was super compliant and patient with me. I struggled to use the upper straight forceps on the 53, holding the tooth by the CEJ was a lot harder than it was in SIM clinic. \n",
      "Problems that I think occurred in this appt was my lack of communication with my supervisor. While I presented my patient to them before they pt arrived, I did not give my supervisor a heads up that I would grab the pt when they arrived. This was not very professional of me as my supervisor didn't realised the pt was in the chair until I was ready to take the radiographs. Additionally, I forgot to mention to my supervisor that the pt had autism and Asperger's syndrome after their mother told me about it, whilst there were no contraindications because they didn't take any medications relating to those conditions, I still needed to inform this to my supervisor to show that I understood what is going on, the steps I would need to take to approach the pt and to allow my supervisor to know what kind of pt they would be meeting when they examine what I've completed.\n",
      "At the end of the appt the pt's mother mentioned that the pt had asthma and also took Ventolin. While this had no contraindications with the procedures today, it was something that I needed to know beforehand. Next time I will make sure to ask about the medical history/conditions in more detail so the parents/patients don't forget to mention it.\n",

I assumed that the SSC in the case were placed in the normal order (Q1, Q2 and the Q4, Q3).

Overall the procedure went smoothly and the pt was happy with the result. I didn't have a lot of excess coming out from under the crown, which I thought may not have been very good, but after speaking with my supervisor, it was not a bad thing. Lots of excess would mean that I used too much GIC under the crown, but if only a little came out then it would be good as it meant I still got the seal without creating a lot of mess.\n",

The pt's parents requested to have the deciduous tooth taken out as the pt had pain every now and then, however because they were quite young the pt refused the extraction upon seeing the needle. My DDS partner attempted to extract it but no success. We discussed with the supervisor what to do in the future, and I was informed that the loss of compliance was mostly because the pt saw the LA needle. If I had a pt like this in the future, I will make sure to hide the needle from them until the last moment, placing the syringe next to my thigh, hidden away.\n",

I think one of the main reasons I was able to get all of this completed within the time frame and with a bit more time to spare was because of how compliant the child was. This was my first time placing separators onto a pt since last time the kid was not compliant. The pt today did flinch slightly but was happy for me to go ahead. I ended up using green Separators on the 65 but for the 84 I was not able to get it on successfully as the band was sticking far too out from the occlusal surface of the tooth. This issue occurred for both the green and blue separators that I tried. I asked my supervisor to help afterwards and she inserted the whole separator under the contact point before easing one side above it. Next time I will try making the whole thing go under the contact if the usual method does not work\n",

Appt was fairly straight forward. I left some plaque on the buccal surfaces of the 16 and 26. Next time I will make sure that all plaque is removed as well since it is a clean that I am doing and leaving some of it behind is not ideal.\n",

      "Student Reflection: 1st pt of the day was for CONS, I saw the patient and completed a 11DP and 45L restoration on them. The 11DP cavity prep was very small and minimal as the caries was not deep, I managed to finish the prep and resto within the hour (the whole appt was 1.2hrs +10min for notes) before moving onto the next restoration which was the 45L. This one was not carious, the pt's lingual cusp had fractured off so I simply smoothed it out and then did the restoration with a tofflemire matrix. This also went quite nice and I was able to get smooth margins with no overhangs and the pt's bite when checked with articulating paper was also quite nice. For the restorations today, instead of using etchant, primer and bond, I only used etchant and bond, no primer was required because the bond material was a hybrid of the usual SDF primer and bond. This was a new material and it was nice to use. I also learnt that after placing flowable composite into the cavity, instead of curing it straight away, I can place packable composite straight onto it to help ease the flowable into the cracks of the tooth (if any) and have it seal nicely before curing the resin. I found this extremely helpful. In the future, if my supervisors allow it I will try it again.\n",

After introducing all the instruments to her, I started to use it. Halfway through she got nervous and did not appreciate the sound of a sickle probe or a perio probe scratching along their teeth. The pt was not tolerant with the radiograph films and would not open for it after a while. I ended up not taking any radiographs because they did not want to take one, but overall from what I could see via the clinical exam the teeth were fairly healthy, only some plaque on the teeth.\n",

      "2nd pt was the 1st pt's older sister (8yrs old), I saw her for an exam as well. The pt had autism and ADHD so did not like the sound of the triplex. I ended up using guaze to try the teeth instead. Like the younger sibling they did not appreciate the radiograph film but were more willing to try it out several times before finally saying 'no' and refusing to let it go near them. When my supervisor took a look at them, they used the triplex on the pt. They were a bit more forceful than I was but the pt was happy to try it out after having the air blown on them for a few seconds. Next time I will try to be a bit more forceful with the younger patients especially if they do not want a certain instrument. I won't force it on them, but I will try to get them to experience it first instead of just letting them say 'no' and then not using it at all.\n",

I took a BW and PA to assess the apex due to the TTP. There was still a clear band of dentine so my diagnosis was reversible pulpitis, with PDL inflammation/symptomatic apical periodontitis? It will be interesting to see if the resto lasts as due to the postive TTP and radiolucency around the furcation area, we did recommend exo for this tooth, however pt wanted to try a resto first. I completed the prep and went ahead with vitrebond as a liner due to the close proximity to pulp, followed by flowable to get into in the nooks and crannys, followed by composite.

      "* great learning measure to always take BW’s before placing FS as there could be some initial caries RA3. The prevention measure leaned to open the tooth using SS bur size 1-2 and place a  Conseal FS. Very great preventative measure as the caries appeared to be soft. \n",
      "* start taking BW’s within the age of 4 would be an appropriate choice where possible. Where possible depends on the child compliance and risks statutes \n",
      "* First time using conseal FS, and it was really great experience. I really enjoyed using conseal. Leaned to always remove the excessive with a probe and micro brush. \n",
      "* over-retainer deciduous teeth with not much mobility best to wait for more mobility to avoid LA. \n",
      "* Decidous molars wait until 15 for EXO and that’s normal. \n",

      "What I learnt: Bevelling cusps with round bur is important for increasing surface area to strengthen bonding. Important to have good bonding otherwise restoration is unsatisfactory and can cause lots of pain for pt. Dentine was needed to be removed in order to have good bonding. Although it is important to do the distal cusp overlay for the patient to avoid sensitivity for the patient, the restoration cannot be too high as this will cause fracture and resto will be unsatisfactory. Therefore need to polish very well. \n",
      "Edu Feedback: When there is not a lot of space in the occlusion for a restoration, it can often end up being over-polished and occlusal dentine may get exposed which can be very sensitive. This can also be exposed by bruxism, so if they are complaining of pain on chewing, check the occlusal surface with your probe to see if you can find any sensitive spots.\n",

      "Student Reflection: 1st session: I took pts mhx and p/c and quickly realised pts concerns were outside of my scope. I let supervisor know and instead assisted for a DDS5 Latrobe student treating this pt. It was a very interesting case where the pt  was advised by a private dentist a week ago that he needed 2 crowns, however wanted them done cheaper so came here. However, once diagnostics were completed it was discovered that the tx options were a lot different to what was suggested as tooth 1 would be too difficult for a general dentist or student to put a crown on due to its restoration being broken and the bone being too high. Instead this tooth was suggested to be assessed by pros. When taking a PA of tooth 2, an infection was found at the apex and this confirmed the -ve vitality test result, hence the tooth was indicated for an endodontist to assess for RCT. It was good watching how the student explained this tricky situation with very clear and empathetic communication.\n",

They are a priority patient (mental health client) with polypharmacy. In this appointment It took 4 attempts for me to anaesthetise the patient, and even so the patient still claimed to be not numb enough for the highspeed drill to be used. I think I could have improved with pt communication and explain to them better what feeling they could expect from the handpiece (vibration, cold feeling due to water etc.). \n",

Reassure pt that they can keep their phone and look at it while they are in the chair and then throughout the appointment, just worked with the pt to see what their boundaries are. Eventually, the patient was giggling and completely put their phone down, just using it as a stim (tapping), rather than looking at it. They listened to me well and we worked together if something was out of their comfort zone and I asked frequently if they were okay with \"insert action\" or if they were feeling okay just in general. I think I did a good mix of making sure the patient is part of decision making but keeping information at the level that is suitable for them, also ensuring the patient's caretaker (their mum in this case) also understands exactly what is needed at the same time (like while talking to the patient about treatment, I also am talking to the mum and making sure I get consent from both (but mostly the caretaker) At times I talk strictly to the caretaker, I would then talk to the patient afterwards to make sure that they understand. \n",

While the procedure for an adjustment is outside of my scope, it was still important to learn how to assess a denture, and how the adjustments are made. Additionally, learn how to explain to pt regarding the current state of their denture and manage expectations of the outcome of getting a new denture. The student operator also eloquently explained the OHI for dentures that can be useful for when I see denture patient too, especially regarding use of Polident for retention. \n",

Took the pain history and identified that the sensitivity may be due to carious lesion on 47M. Did my first SDF and GIC resto. This required me to use new materials that I will do more reading on.  Completed buccal infill resto for soft tissue anaesthesia. Retraction cord 00 size and gingival barrier to prevent gingival burns. Required the guidance of supervisor and DDS partner on the use of riva star SDF but learnt a lot. This appt was also really good experience to practice empathy and positive reinforcement with pt with mild dental anxiety, and due to personal reasons due to currently taking multiple psychotic meds and dealing with dry mouth and its consequences. \n",

Continue practicing repeating mental notes to ensure nothing is missed i.e. PA for 45 or endofrost of 28 before bringing supervisor in. Ensure charting reflects the dentition even if it is someone else's odontogram. Time management with exam could also improve, however, a lot was done in this appt, and addressed one of the PC's of the pt's. \n",

Pt seemed satisfied with the clean and OHI. \n",

      "SO Feedback: Assisted for two pts in the morning. The first pt was for denture impression, I assisted in mixing the alginate to prepare for the impression. I learnt that for a pt with an existing denture, it's important to have a tray with one size up to ensure there is enough material to cover the teeth and denture. The second pt was an emergency pt with pain, it required a thorough pain history as the pt has been seeking tx overseas recently. Additionally, reviewing the patient's options, risks, and benefits and allowing the patient to think them through properly provides more certainty about what treatment would be done. In this case, the pt did want to get out of pain, but as the CHC only does stage 1 of RCT, they will need to continue RCT privately. The student operator did a great job in explaining it concisely and ensuring the patient made an informed decision, this is a great skill that I would like to continue improving on as well, even if that took time. \n",

      "What I did well: Pt was in distress during appt due to the immense pain they were in, I was able to help relieve their pain by administering LA first before discussing tx options with them. After LA, I was able to provide the pts with all their options regarding the 26. Pt was reciprocative and asked questions which was a good indication that my communication regarding tx options was clearly explained to provide an informed decision. Additionally, the diagnosis of perio-endo involvement of 26 was accurate. \n",

Quite a difficult case; however the experience supporting the DDS4 in helping maintain moisture control for an equigingival restoration was really amazing.

If the remaining tooth structure in insufficient to support a matrix band or V3 system, you can build up part of the tooth freehand then use that to support a matrix system. this usually requires a lot of assistance from the DA\n",

Completed a limited exam and radiograph for an emergency CAT1 patient who required an extraction which was outside of my scope of practice; interesting to see a difficult adult extraction completed by my DDS pair; made me reflect on my own paediatric extractions; using gentle smooth movements. Ultimately, lots of learning despite not carrying out final procedure including making cotton pellets and ensuring it is placed on the true buccal; for more reliable vitality testing. Also learnt about micro-sterile environments; will definitely be mindful in the future. Also remember to not remove gloves when taking x-ray.\n",

Generally a Dx of irreversible pulpitis can only be achieved histologically, but if the pt is experiencing constant pain including at night from a tooth that is still responsive to endofrost, a Dx of irreversible pulpitis can be justified. if there are two teeth next to each other that are both carious, you cannot be sure that the symptoms are coming from both teeth. You need to use your judgement as to which tooth the symptoms are mostly coming from and review the other one once that has been managed.\n",

Lots of learning regarding restoration process, particularly ensuring to adapt the mylar band fully; wrapping around both mesial and distal for increased stability when a wedge is unable to be used. Poor time management required assistance from demonstrator to complete hence no for competence and time management. \n",

As these preps extended almost reaching sub gingival -&gt; I felt uncomfortable with scope; happy to hand over to DDS colleague to help complete.

DA did all the talking to help ease the patient. Waving LA around infront of child pt not okay. Pt refused to comply with 2nd round of LA because he saw the needle - fortunately enough LA was given the first time but if there wasn't enough, this would have been disastrous. Relied on DA to complete notes and not checking if all correct. Poor patient management. Unsafe. Needed to be prompted throughout the appt. \n",

      "Student Reflection: Patient 1: This patient was my first experience of seeing someone that identifies as homeless. I was a bit unsure on behavioural management and think that I could have done a bit better, although I did work on building some rapport. This patient had heavy attrition, missing teeth and carious lesions that I found quite difficult to chart. Demonstrator and I discussed counting teeth from the central incisors in order to determine whether the molars that are present are 6's/7's or 8's. I also completed a perio chart today. I think my time management for this patient was not very good. I went overtime and could tell the patient was eager to leave. I took too long with my perio chart especially. I also think that I was quite unsure on how to manage this patient and needed to be prompted to take PA's and treatment planning. In the future I should utilise the techniques that my demonstrator taught me about charting and study up on carious lesions/management and my scope of practice and knowing when to refer to a dentist. Also need to remember to enter notes directly into Titanium and not onto a notepad, because it will be easier for my demo to read and less likely to make mistakes with charting that way. \n",

      "Patient 2: This patient was booked in for an exam which turned out to be a surprise EXO. For this patient, I really made an effort to build rapport with both patient and mum and I think I am doing a bit better. Time management was slightly better although I still went overtime. Demonstrator and I discussed LA techniques and I learnt a new technique for intrapapillary injections today which I found really cool. I also spent a lot of time going through OH today and I think my explanations were good. I should work on my explanations of treatments and things like bitewings as well because I feel that I am still not articulating myself well there. I should also try and be more systematic when explaining things to my supervisor. Remember to change gloves whenever I touch the chair as this is an infection control issue. \n",

I was also happy with my periodontal charting today - I was mostly accurate. I felt that the moral of today's story was to work on visibility when debriding with hand scales especially and I've learnt to keep the teeth relatively dry when hand debriding so that the calculus is more visible. I will work on this at my next opportunity. I enjoyed today - it was my first fully good day in the clinic this year. I'm feeling optimistic about taking feedback and being on my journey of improvement this year! \n",

Probing was better this week, please ensure you are not over angulation at IP areas.

Did not have much experience doing restos last year or so far this year. so I was taking my time and therefore feel like I should be better with my time management next time.

Also if I think i cannot angle a certain bur, using a different one to polish more effectively rather than trying to get the same bur to work.

I also observed that when anaesthetising the tongue, the clinician had the needle bent slightly for easy access.  I saw a few cases where there was mild dysplasia and need review my oral med notes. I also got to see the healing of a biopsies where the clinician had to take another biospy to see if it would promote healing. Though that had failed, so they did a steroid injection as well as the corticosteroid. Thus helped promote healing but caused thrush, thus the clinician gave chlorohexidine as well as check the healing process. I also learnt that epithelial lysis is also known as the pealing of the mucosa and can be due to the toothpaste. I also learned that cancer usually occurs  posteriorly and lower region of the mouth rather than the upper anterior region.  Biopsies are generally take where the lesion is the thickest as well. \n",

Moreover I got to learn about the placement of the brackets and how they are design with curvature of the teeth as majority of people have the same curvature of the teeth. I learnt that lingual braces are rarely placed due to moisture control, difficulty with placement and chances of getting trauma from the tongue. I also learned that ceramic braces are rarely chosen due to how well they can bond to the enamel thus risking the clinician having to remove enamel when removing the braces.

      "Student Reflection: Today was my first restoration on a pt. My first 47 DO was quite difficult. I had trouble access and identifying when the DEJ was completely caries free. Filling the composite into the prep was also challenging.  I found it difficult especially because the tooth was further back. my resto was bulkier than I had wanted with some overhang. Leaving more overhangs meant that I had to polish more which affected my timeliness during the appointment. Finding the right angulation with the soft flex disc was also challenging for me. In future to improve my overall Restos and timeliness I will make sure to apply more pressure when creating my prep, adding enough composite so that the filling is sufficient, experiment with different angles when polishing. I will also use the articulating paper more to assist with occlusion check. \n",

      "Student Reflection: - I did 3 upper restorations today for the first time on a pt (16D,17MO, 17D). This session taught me a lot about how to deliver LA more effectively (topical LA until the skin wrinkles, PSAN and MSAN for better anesthesia). \n",
      "- my rubber dam placement was quite rusty but I found that the rubber dam helped a lot especially because the pt had lots of saliva so achieving adequate moisture control this way made the resto more manageable. For the prep I need to be confident in extending the prep more palataly. I was able to see that the DEJ still had caries however I was more reluctant to remove it since it was close to the gingiva.  next time  I will better trust my instincts and be more confident in my caries removal prep. i also left a bur mark on the 16D which could have been prevented by leaving a thin layer of enamel when clearing the contact/wedge guard barrier).  in terms of the resto I need to work on creating the marginal ridge so that the base of the prep is also filled too. i learnt that flowable composite can be used in addition to composite to make sure the base of the resto is completely filled and that there are no voids. My polishing in interproximal areas needs improvement. In terms of pt notes i should be putting if i left a bur mark on the adjacent tooth so that the notes are as acurate as possible, that's why i ticked no to professional and ethical conduct.\n",

The preparation was very deep and required a lot of assistance, as a result the pulp showed some blushing and required a dycal and vitro bond which the supervisor did. Was able to justify and apply knowledge that dycal was required and stop preparation when noticed blushing. Learnt a new technique of using flowable and composite together, and then curing together to fill the void. The palatal surface was smooth yet some defects on the distal which was fixed with the supervisor. Polishing was also done by the supervisor due to being over time. Initially thought saline was necessary, however learnt that sodium hypochlorite is more recommended (no necessary in this situation) as the pulp was not exposed and bleeding. \n",

I learned that I should be more firm with diagnostic tests, such as asking “We are going to do  …, this is because …”. This way patients understand the reasoning for the necessity of these tests, rather than thinking it’s ok to not have perio chart done. Also, even if the extent of  bone loss is different in different regions, we still call it stage x, where x refers to the site of greatest loss.\n",

      "Student Reflection: The first pt was routine, where I saw him for a recall. During the appt I noticed deep pits and fissures, which I thought may benefit from fissuring sealants as it was plaque retentive. After discussion with supervisor I learned that for adults with low caries risk, OHI may be more helpful. Therefore I ended up doing a thorough OHI with brushing and flossing. Left some calc in lower 3s and 4s IP. Supervisor said there may be more build up due to the arch/ anatomy change. The pt was happy and said he was happy with my service. He was discharged with discharge letter to CHC and waitlist transfer letter.\n",

      "Obs Feedback: today I had an observation session for Paeds, Level 1 at RDHM and observed an application of SDF with the addition of duraphat on top of the SDF to increase the fluoride absorption by 5% and to reduce the decay. this was a new process I hadn't seen before and found very interesting. seeing this new process reminded me of the importance of updating and reading up on new literature to ensure best practice but also to find out new innovative ways of completing treatment. fortunately, the child was quite compliant and calm and willingly opened their mouth throughout the appt and received stickers and a squishy toy as a form of distraction and positive reinforcement. there were also discussions about diet with the pt's father where they discussed the importance of limiting sugar, esp in juice - reiterating the importance of dietary advice as the father was unaware of the sugar content in juice. I also viewed an OPG of a separate pt of whom had a fused lateral and canine tooth (72, 73) where it was explained that the most common teeth that have dens invaginatus are the lateral and the first premolar - and that it was more common in the asian population but was not limited to their race.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also observed an autistic patient who had FM duraphat applied using a toothbrush as the applicator. I haven't had the experience of seeing patients with special needs so I found the experience quite interesting and again hadn't seen duraphat applied by a toothbrush either. the pt was rather wriggly but responded to instructions and was able to open their mouth long enough for the duraphat to be applied after allowing the pt time to relax in between applications. I observed tell show do being used as well as desensitisation and positive reinforcement.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also briefly observed some Fuji 9 being applied on a very young patient (presumably under 6) with some slow speed drilling. the clinician had opted to use Fuji 9 for the pt and did not use vaseline to seal - again, the clinician used some desensitisation and tell show do with the pt and showed them what each thing they were using was for and allowed the pt to touch and feel it before placing it in their mouth. in this appt, I could see the difference tell show do made, and also saw how counting down greatly improved the patient's ability to leave their mouth open for a duration of time. \n",
      "\n",
      "the last pt i observed was 6 and had a small cr placed on their 53B as well as a max occlusal radiograph taken. I observed a slow speed being utilised as well as the use of etch only - reaffirmed with clinician that if the child is complacent, using cr for a non-carious tooth can be the preferred choice - esp if the tooth will not exfoliate soon. the pt repeatedly expressed concern over their tooth being taken out (mesiodens between 11,21) but was reassured and calm throughout both procedures, using a hand mirror to observe what was being done - which appeared to aid in easing his anxieties. observing a max occlusal radiograph being taken was interesting as I have been unable to take one personally but recalled the angulation being on top of the patient's nose and observed the outcome of the radiograph also, showcasing the periapical region of the permanent mesiodens - discussing the management of the tooth outside OHT scope \n",

I also learnt about the instructions required for savacol mouthwash which I did not previously know\n",

I think I could also improve upon my timeliness however my second pt did have a rather distressing phone call and had requested to be sitting semi-upright for the appointment which made me struggle a bit with angulation and also with my ease of access in their mouth.

We concluded at the end of the appointment, following our investigations, that the pt was experiencing dentinal hypersensitivity. I think the way my operator conducted the tests was good however the way she presented the findings sounded like she was dismissing the patient's symptoms. Telling the patient \"we're getting mixed signals....one tooth you're saying it hurts, then when I test it again you're saying it doesn't hurt\" felt like it was dismissing the pts feelings. This is just how i interpreted it when my operator discussed it, her tone and other communication skills were still great but the actual words could have probably been worded differently.

The initial plan was a 17MO restoration and I was nervous but I reminded myself of my goal (to overcome cons anxiety) which eased myself slightly. I became more comfortable polishing using the HS and SS discs, and using the articulating paper today. Next time, I'n gonna use my HS bur more to polish to save time on polishing. \n",

I was a bit nervous so my hand was shaking but I think over time as I build more confidence I will get better. The patient presented with heavy calculus so it took my supervisor and I some time to remove everything. This was the most calculus I have ever seen on my patient. I think I need to work on my hand scaling esp. angulations and going deeper into the pocket to remove everything. We went over time by 20 minutes but the patient left happy with the results. \n",

My probing depths were a bit off and this is something I think I need to improve on. I haven't had much experience completing perio charts.

This is the youngest pt I have ever seen. Previous to this appt, I did not know we also do occlusion for children as young as 3. Also, our uni lectures focus mainly on occlusion for adult dentitions and we haven't had lectures on primary dentition occlusion so I didn't think much of it today. I will look into it in my own time. \n",

Apparently, the supervisor did tell us beforehand to dismiss but it was unclear to my DA and I. Next time, we will clarify before the supervisor leaves so there isn't any confusion. \n",

It really took me by surprise and under a bit of stress as it impacted my session time. Doug completed a temporary resto with a tofflemire. I also had no assigned DA which made debridement a bit difficult but there was 3 people going in and out helping me out. As the supervisor advised, I went into the waiting to explain to my second patient that I was going to be 15-20 minutes late which the pt was very understanding of. One of the RDHM DAs gave me a really good piece of advice which was to stay calm when unexpected things happen as it can in turn make the patient panic/distrust the clinician which I hope to do moving forward. \n",

I did a perio assessment, 26 PA and debridement with hand scalers. I still need to work on my technique for debridement as well as revisit my hand instrument knowledge. Whilst debriding, I chipped off some of the 26 amalgam resto so I had to stop my debridement and move the pt to a DDS student to restore the tooth as there was endo involvement.

I have never seen abfraction so prominent and frequent in a patient's mouth before. We accidently worked a bit backwards by commencing debridement without a diagnosis but we got there in the end.

Pt loved the story and even helped me choose the colour of the fairy's shoes. The restoration itself was a little difficult. The tooth was small so was had to fit my burs in sometimes. The first resto the supervisor filled for me to demonstrate, and assisted me a little with the cavity prep. The second resto I did on my own and was able to open up the contact point. However when checking the resto at the end there was an opening interproximally that makes it unsat. So the supervisor had to redo it due to time constraints.

We were a little rusty coming back but it has been a good day; learnt how to take an OPG, how to manage paeds patient and their parents/cleaning with cavitron + pain management. I think as an operator the next following two days I’ll create a plan in my head and constantly be thinking of what to do next to improve on time management as well as patient management. Very excited to see paeds patients again after the long break\n",

      "Student Reflection: Patient 1: First IAN block. Had Interpreter, managing patient with an interpreter, managing patients with anxiety - lots of learning, my hands were shaking!! but good practice for my next IAN in the afternoon.  It was difficult to handle this patient as she was constantly feeling sensitive and it was difficult to build rapport with someone that does not speak the same language as me. But I was ok at comforting her. Dr Loan helped me with this IAN + translating \n",
      "Patient 2: Perio chart, smoking cessation (?), OPG! Great to see how to use OPG machine. DEtected more calculus from last clean, so booked pt in for further cleaning. Good rapport\n",
      "Patient 3: Mental nerve block injection, good clean, difficult conversations about prognosis of tooth especially if it is grade 3 mobile but ultimately respecting patient's wishes and autonomy even if the prognosis is extremely poor. \n",
      "Patient 4: Heavy calculus, managed to get all off + booked in for a lot of F/S\n",
      "Patient 5: Another IAN, vietnamese patient with no interpreter booked - very difficult to communicate but Dr Loan was able to translate again. Made me think about attempting to learn basic dental terms in Vietnamese LOL\n",
      "Patient 6: I had no idea what to do for this patient because of the restoration that was placed that was very unsatisfactory. Managed his PC well which was hypersensitivity of the 44 where no pathology/caries could be seen from the x-ray. This patient was very talkative, I think I can improve on trying to redirect the conversation to the appt Lol.  Not sure how to manage patients with unsatisfactory restorations, good learning experience watching Dr Loan talk to the patient about options. \n",

      "Patient 1: 2 BW, 3 F/S. Important to encourage pt, come up with ways to distract and desensitise patient with a strong gag reflex, even with rubber dam and Garners clamp- if cannot do, just go with the method that the patient will be able to handle. Originally i did not know what to speak to the patient about, so I want to start learning to just talk so the patient feels more comfortable. Make sure the fissure sealant covers all the pits/grooves etc so that the patient is effectively having preventive tx conducted. lightly tap the FS material with a feather touch before placing vaseline. Lots of support from Milly, I learnt a lot from observing her rapport with patient and the communication/behavioural strategies from her. \n",
      "Patient 2: good rapport, good bitewings; referral letter to orthodontist, missing teeth/congenitally missing, coming up with treatment plan for this was difficult but lots of support from Milly; she made it seem much more simpler - important to have a problem list and think about what routes to go and provide options for the parent as well. I think exams etc are already strong, but treatment planning and providing different options for patients is something I need to work on. \n",
      "Patient 3: patient with ASD, being gentle but justifying that if pt does not have any clinically viewable caries etc, can just wait for next appt to take bws. ohi given to parents, very engaged and motivated to start supervising their children brushing again. \n",
      "Patient 4: SRD, no LA - poor OHI, possibly rec OHE appts next appt as patient was not motivated at all/had chronic health issues. being more empathetic as well is very important. I think because I was flustered from previously appointment, I was not as empathetic as I could have been. Next appt, coming up with a plan of how to improve his ohi and ensure that the cleans are not  \"all for nothing\".\n",
      "Patient 5: exam, RCT, OPG - unsure what to do with RCT temporary tooth. Pt also had a bridge that, even while he was using super floss and taking good care of it, gingiva was still very inflamed. Come up with a better plan for him for his next appt to hopefully see some improvement and prevent bone loss from occurring. Take another look at OHI for bridges. \n",
      "Patient 6: mobile tooth, LA in this case will do more harm than good. great patient, started crying when tooth was unexpectedly pulled out but in the end was great and tooth will no longer bother him. important to balance the pros and cons but this was a great appointment. i was scared to do anything because extractions are engrained in my head to be irreversible, but this tooth was already mobile and the 41 was partially erupted. \n",

Milly provided a lot of support but overall I was happy with how I performed during this appointment. Good rapport, able to answer patient questions\n",
      "Pt 2: Fissure sealants using conseal and dry guard isolation. I think I should have used this opportunity to practice rubber dam on a paeds patient but after trying twice and pt slightly in pain, I decided to use other form of isolation. This compromised the quality of the fissure sealants so I think I should have tried again or asked for more support. Two fissure sealants turned out great, other two needed more topping up as moisture control was not good. \n",
      "Pt 3: Quick exam to confirm need for SSC and cons. In the future, it is always important to not just blindly follow another clinician's exam/diagnosis/treatment plan and conduct your own as you are liable for your treatment. It was a good experience to do another exam and provide a justification as to why following the treatment plan is needed. Pt ended up not needing any SSC as teeth were showing signs of resorption. I did a GIC restoration of cavitated 75DO and 85DO. Good restoration, some polishing needed. First time using Tofflemire which was scary. Pt very compliant, good rapport and happy pts and family in the end. They wanted to see me again which was a nice feeling. \n",
      "Pt 4: Pt that needed seps put in. Quick exam and then placed seps. Good rapport, lots of OH provided. Excited to see pt again for possible exo.\n",
      "Pt 5: New patient, understood some Vietnamese which helped as interpreter did not show up. Not a complex exam however able to do good radiographic interpretation and address PC as some teeth had widening PDL and furcation involvement. No further tx required only monitor\n",
      "Pt 6: Saw DDS do denture assessment. Also did OPG, I think I am a lot better at taking OPGs/preparing pt to take an OPG - a lot more confident and taking it slower than I did last week. Had a good discussion about dentures with DDS \n",

Was able to see how diet and habits of the child develops into ECC (such as nursing habits and diet such as juices and drinks). It is important to have a good conversation with parents and guardians and provide good OHI and dietary advise. Had the chance to review OPGs. On one of the radiographs, an abnormality was noted of the eruption of a successor. Could be a cyst/ abscess of the deciduous that is now affecting the permanent tooth. There was a team of professionals in the department and I could see how they worked together to figure out if it was a cyst or anything else. This was a reminder that when in doubt to reach out to colleagues who will support you. \n",
      "Viewed the use of SDF on children and applying duraphat afterwards increases efficiency. It was important to discuss with parents how the tooth will appear black after applying SDF. Tatianna showed pictures to the parents which was an effective way to demonstrate how it would appear. This was a motivation to research more on SDF and its effects. Further learnt how properly written referrals aid the next clinician. The referral we looked at had good information on the child’s behaviour and compliance, habits at home and how motivated the parents are, any social and dental histories as well. It was a good comprehensive guide and allows the next clinician to plan appropriately for care. Also never heard of a three sided toothbrush but it was good to know today for children to use when they struggle to brush. \n",

In future, I should use V3 matrix to ensure that the contact is bulbous enough and not a thin section that can be fractured off. Additionally, I shouldve adjusted the occlusion more  prior to the use of articulating paper. Ultimately, I required assistance from my supervisor to finish off the restoration. \n",

Goal of procedure was to complete exos on time and no patient pain. Had some initial difficulty achieving local anesthesia - supervisor suggested intraligamentary injection, and it was successful. Was able to exo without issues, and even overcome a tooth that decoronated (was able to remove remaining root). Able to complete 7 exos on time.

Can use more controlled force when expanding socket of sound tooth. Similar finger rest when getting upper universal forceps as far apically as possible.

Luxation achieved some mobility but would’ve liked more, crown fractured when loosening with forceps (upper universal). Roots were firmly fixed, had to be luxated individually with Coupland #2 & 3. Coupland are known to be more traumatic due to the sharp corners and curvature of blade removing more bone. Coupland should be used to fulcrum out roots individually Visibility difficult due to depth of root. MB root delivered with Coupland and upper straight narrow beak forceps. DB root difficult to remove due to proximity of 18 crown. Cryers used to engage root, kept slipping due to poor access and bleeding.

The PA provided by the general clinic of 36 was different to the clinical/OPG presentation of the tooth, and thus there was a mis-match. Called the clinic and they confirmed no procedures had been completed. Required discussion of treatment options and need for medical clearance from GP and medical history form to be updated prior to extraction of 36 due to MRONJ risk.

Pt had an implant adjacent to the tooth that was likely ill-placed and caused an R5 lesion to progression on the 37MO, clinically there was no cavitation. Isolation was difficult for this reason, as there was no gingiva to invert the dam into, meaning we had to use oraseal for sub-optimal isolation. Once the MO aspect was restored, we attempted to access the tooth for pulp extirpation, however the patient was too sensitive - even after multiple attempts at supplemental LA. AB prescription provided and pt rebooked for extirpation in two weeks. \n",

      "My second patient had a complex Med hx comprising of: Multiple Sclerosis, asthma, anxiety, and ovarian cysts. This patient also had complex social history being a person who identifies as Aboriginal and at risk of homelessness. While my patient required a relatively routine restoration, her care was complex given her medical and social needs. I realized that to better serve this patient  I needed to consider my patient communication to improve the quality of the consultation. Namely,  I needed to have a comprehensive medical and social history, ensure that my patient felt safe in the dental environment (I emphasized to her that previous recreational drug use did not preclude her from care but allowed us to better-tailored care), and communicated with her throughout the procedure to ensure she felt empowered a member of the care team. I also checked in with her throughout the appointment, gave her opportunities to ask questions and voice her concerns, and gave her frequent breaks. Moreover, I made efforts to tweak my procedure to optimize her comfort. For example, the rubber dam is the gold standard for isolation but I recognized that my patient would struggle to tolerate this due to her asthma. Instead, I achieved isolation with cheek guards, buccal cotton rolls, V3 matrix, and diligent suctioning. Tiny measures such as these can improve the overall experience and likelihood of the patient presenting again for prophylactic dental treatment (e.g., regular checkups and cleans).\n",

These measures went a long way in helping the patient feel calm, safe, and capable of continuing with the procedure.

      "In addition to the above, I also learned about the use of the Riva Star Fluoride system today with Fuji to restore caries in certain  cases. For example, I was discussing a case today with the Demo, I learned that when managing deep unrestorable caries, we can consider a \"tunneling\" technique to expose the active caries to the Riva fluoride system. After arresting the  caries, the tooth can be restored with Fuji. This technique increases treatment options in certain cases and can allow us to retain teeth that were otherwise indicated for extraction. \n",

In emergency appointments, you often don't get much time, so we usually need to focus on the presenting complaint, otherwise you may run out of time. In this case, you were able to manage the presenting complaint quickly, so there was time for you to look at other issues. Notes need to be focused on the presenting complaint. Don't put things in Dx that you haven't talked about in the examination or investigations as there is no indication of how you arrived at this diagnosis.\n",

      "SO Feedback: In observing my BOH partner today, I learned key strategies and considerations required when managing a language barrier with patients. For example, the BOH student today accounted for extra time in an appointment to accommodate tele-interpreting services. She wanted to set aside 10-15 minutes (with interpretation) for OHI. It can be challenging to access interpreting services and they are not as flawless in reality due to speaker and microphone quality, surrounding noise, and difference in dialects. All this being said, I had great appreciation for her efforts. I realized that patients who face language barriers are more likely to not receive OHI, tobacco counselling, and diet counselling because of the inconvenience associated with accessing interpretation services and time constraints in practice. This means these patients may lack foundational knowledge and skills that would empower them to take control of their oral health.\n",

      "Student Reflection: 1) Interpretation of Radiographs\n",
      "- A key learning today was related to the interpretation of radiographs. Specifically, lesions in radiographs may present differently clinically. For example, a BW radiograph suggested that a tooth had MO caries which was not apparent clinically. Instead, my demonstrator uncovered mesio-buccal cervical caries which were presented as the \"MO caries\" on the radiograph. This was an important lesson about cautiously reading radiographs and cross-referencing radiographs with clinical presentation. I realized that the radiograph is a 2D image which cannot differentiate between buccal and occlusal. Another strategy I learned was walking the probe along the tooth surface to detect catches and cavitations which may not be otherwise visible. \n",

      "I realized that these patients may be unable to prioritize their oral health as their overall health requires more attention. I also needed to consider the impact of - medications, frequent appointments, lifestyle changes, and reduced capacity for self-care- on someone's oral health. For example, patients with polypharmacy have a heightened risk of reduced saliva flow which in turn can increase caries and periodontal disease risk. Also, patients have limited control over their diet and hygiene when spending extended time hospitalized or in residential living facilities. Moreover, there is a psychological component. \n",
      "Both of the patients today felt embarrassed that they had neglected their oral health and the deterioration in the health of their gums and teeth. To start, I commended patients for taking the first step and attending today's appointment.  I explained that it is natural for other things to take priority over our oral health- but what's important is that we keep on trying our best. Next, I explained different OH and diet counselling strategies to empower them to take control of their oral health. For one patient, I also organized an Oral Health Educator appointment. My goal was to demonstrate an understanding of patient's circumstances and ensure they do not feel judged- instead, I wanted them to feel encouraged. \n",

      "In speaking with these patients, my takeaway was that managing comorbidities can cause deterioration in both our physiological as well as psychological health and this has implications for patient's oral health and sense of control over their well-being.

Her treatment plan required RCT, caries, unsatisfactory restorations, and poor OH. Initially, I felt discouraged by the state of the patient's oral health- 'how could things deteriorate rapidly to this state?'. However, I took a step back and realized that the patient may not have had the benefit of education and knowledge about the etiology of caries and gum disease. \n",

I explained that if disease is allowed to progress, we are limited in what we can do to save the tooth. Moreover, I used visual aids including a diagram of caries/endo in the surgery, and the patient's PAs to outline the disease progression.  The patient also presented with her son who acted as an interpreter which was immensely helpful.\n",

      "Student Reflection: Today's learnings as an operator are related to managing complex patients who require familiar procedures. For example, the first patient I cared for today was due to have full clearance followed by F/F fabrication in a private clinic (which he was saving for). From the previous patient notes, I did not feel confident had provided *informed* consent and/or understood the challenges associated with a denture (and fabrication options). Accordingly, I devoted a significant portion of the appointment to discussing 1) retaining mandibular teeth to support the -/P retention and 2) denture fabrication options, RDHM would have a 3-month wait time which coincided with his healing time. These conversations resulted in a modification to the treatment plan where the patient opted to retain Md teeth where possible as opposed to a full clearance. While the patient still preferred to have the dentures fabricated privately, it was important to alert him to more cost-effective options as he faced financial barriers. Moreover, this appointment impressed upon that the treatment plan is a living/dynamic plan that should be open to change as the patient and clinical priorities evolve. \n",

      "SO Feedback: As a support operator, I learned how to assess non-odontogenic pain. For example, a patient presented today with pain that was \"bringing [me] to tears\" and localized it near the angle of their mandible. The patient had sought care from a naturopath who had \"relieved emotional trauma\" in his jaw. The patient had strong thoughts regarding health, wellbeing, and the cause of his discomfort. Taking care of a patient with complex needs and personality traits required a multi-pronged approach which I observed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, management of this patient involves thorough diagnostic testing including radiographs, pulp sensibility, and I/O examination. Additionally, it involved reassurance and transparency about the purpose of various procedures in assessing his health. It was important to convey to the patient that they were an equal partner in their health. Moreover, it was critical to clear misconceptions about the potential causes of their discomfort, for example, the patient believe there was emotional trauma translating to nerve pathology. The student clinician refocused the conversation to the patient's radiographs and reiterated what they could tell us, what we knew from the intra-oral examination, and what we could do for more answers (e.g., Oral Med Specialist referral). This strategy helped centre the conversation around facts and reassured the patient without undermining his personal health philosophy. \n",

I took care of a patient who had complicated needs due to various factors including a mental health client, a young single parent, and a previous history of drug dependence. From our discussions, I realized that the patient held a sense of embarrassment and shame about the condition of her teeth and was reconciling with her previous drug dependency. \n",
      "\n",
      "In response, I tried to establish rapport with this patient by playing music she enjoyed and assuming a more relaxed demeanour and vocabulary as we were of similar age. I also found it helpful to gauge her attitude as it allowed me to develop a comprehensive treatment plan that was tailored to her specifically. For example, when providing OHI, I acknowledged that she is in shared housing as part of her rehab program and may not have free access to a washroom to brush her teeth. Next, she had little control over her diet because most of her meals were provided by the rehab facility. The dietary advice was adapted to focus on the sugary and acidic beverages that she had free access to all the time. These small modifications to the treatment plan can improve the patient's buy-in and the rate of compliance. \n",

My colleague was managing a patient w/ pulpitis of a broken down 47; active infection and reduce the effectiveness of the LA due to an acidic environment which reduces unionized forms of the medication. Additionally, the patient's medical history included drug dependence. which I learned can reduce susceptibility to LA. These factors coupled together may have contributed to a lack of profound anaesthesia. \n",

      "In these scenarios, I learned that it is key to continuously reassure the patient that you will stop if they are in pain, and then demonstrate this. Persisting with uncomfortable and painful treatment can create distrust and trauma for the patient and operator. Next, I was able to observe various anaesthetic techniques including using multiple different LAs (we used Mepivacaine + Articaine + Lignocaine)buccal and lingual blocks, IAN block, and interligamentary infiltration. Finally, I learned that when you have exhausted all options, consider taking a step back. In this case, we provided the patient with a prescription of antibiotics and asked them to return after 5 days when the infection may have reduced in severity. The hope is that this will create an environment where the LA is more effective. \n",

      "- Managing patient's with complex care needs. For example, multiple patients today were mental health clients who required additional considerations regarding patient communication, their capacity for self-care, and support relating to OHI and diet counselling. Moreover, patients such as refugees and asylum seekers may be navigating language barriers. Today, I conducted a consult in Hindi upon the patient's request; this experience helped me better understand patient perceptions about dental care, oral wellbeing, and approach towards dental procedures (e.g., RCTs, crowns etc.)- while recognizing that one patient's experience do not speak for a whole group. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Time management - I realized that I need to take more control \"steering\" my appointments. I tend to let the patient determine the course of the appointment and help them feel empowered and in control. This means, that I will reassure the patient I won't initiate any treatment unless they are 100% confident and that we can \"wait and see\" if they like. However, this may be counter-intuitive when managing patients that are asking for direction. For example, today my patient was in a great deal of pain on her RHS and was hesitant to extract or take action on the tooth responsible. Instead, she wanted me to look at a tooth that she believed to be carious (ICDAS 2) and I obliged; diverting my attention from the main RFP. \n",
      "\n",
      "I realized I may be doing costing the efficiency and standard of care- based on feedback from my peer and demo. In the future, I will try to strike a balance. It may be helpful to step out of the appointment and consider the main focus which will guide the procedures and diagnostics for that day. Anything else which is less urgent may be better off being managed at subsequent appointments. I think I need to realize that while patients are directing the presenting care and complaints; I need to negotiate the clinical priorities with the patient as well.  \n",

I was able to effectively communicate with the patient discussing the risks associated with wisdom tooth removal, the patient was happy with the explanation. An overall positive session with my first wisdom tooth removal.

Additionally, we were taught about how to get a good, smooth margin. Pushing the drill up and down lightly with your foot and brushing along the tooth- this helps to get a smooth margin without removing more tooth structure. The use of an 'air vent' on the occlusal surface on the temporary crown is helpful with the extension of excess cement and for the temp to seat correctly\n",

      "34 weeks (~8 months) pregnant patient presented with pain on lower right hand side from an initiated root canal treatment. Today, we did instrumentation to disinfect the canal system more effectively to hopefully relieve her pain symptoms. Second time working on 46 RCT and I managed to get angulations of the hand files better this time. Learned that I should not need to put pressure when filing with hand files and that I probably used a lot more force than normal to achieve patency. Also learned to hold the instrumentation device like a pencil rather than with two hands. One crucial point I almost forgot was putting a lead apron for pregnant patients when taking radiographs, had to be reminded by the dental assistant. Happy that the working lengths were accurate today and instrumentation was completed smoothly. Session went well.\n",

      "TMD and OSA patient - she came in due to high levels of aching and sometime shooting pain,  8/10 scale, mainly on the muscles of mastication (temporalis, masseter, lateral pterygoid) but also radiated to the back of her head. The patient also reported headaches and previous history of migraines but has been a long time since she has suffered a migraine. This patient previously have had chemotherapy for cancer which metastasised and is at that stage where the whole body is starting to ache. This patient also has severe OSA and could not tolerate the CPAP machine. Hence, a mandibular advancement splint was made for her. While TMD and OSA has been diagnosed, the pain that has started to flare up in the past few days could be due to many different factors (poor sleep, stress, stretching of the muscles using the MAS). The patient also had neck pain which can be contributing to the jaw pain. In terms of managing this patient, the patient was prescribed Norflex (orphenadrine, anticholinergic antihistamine) used to relax the jaw muscle, physiotherapist for exercises of the jaw and neck, referring back to sleep physician to see how much benefit the MAS is providing the patient, but also warm compresses in the hope for the pain to decrease. Depending how the patient responds in the next 4-6 weeks, the patient may need referral to a neurologist. This appointment highlighted the multifactorial nature of TMD and orofacial pain. As a result, there is a need for different non-invasive treatment modalities to be implemented concurrently.\n",

      "Patient 2:\n",
      "Child with a white tongue. On initial presentation the child patient seemed to have a normal looking tongue. However, a photo from 2-3 weeks ago appear to be more whitish. The patient also has been recently hospitalised for GIT issues at RCH but also has had a skin rash in the past couple of months during her trip overseas which have now subsided. The parents reported that the child had altered her behaviour and showed discomfort to spices and other types of food as a result of her tongue. However, the condition improved after taking nilstat oral drops (antifungal). While the patient appears to be healthy at this visit, it is important to still get comprehensive history taking which includes getting blood results from RCH to confirm that there hasn't been any other factors which may have caused the problem. We also noted the carious lesions on her primary dentition and informed the patient, further highlighting holistic care. All we could do for this appointment was to reassure the family and double check any results. Some take home advice included bland \"boring\" diet not to trigger any discomfort while the tongue appears to be healing.\n",

He is also aware that he has been biting his tongue which appears to have been the initial cause of the ulcer that persisted. This appointment was just to review how the ulcer is healing and deliver the diagnosis of TUGSE to the patient has cancer is always a differential diagnosis on first appearance. During biopsy during the previous visit, they ensured the entire lesion was removed (to the muscular level) and administered intralesional steroid medication before suturing the biopsy site. The patient is also quite medically complex as he is undergoing HIV treatment. Home care instructions were given - e.g. reduce stress, warm compresses and massages for the jaw pain but also to avoid traumatising the area.

In the first case, the patient was moving towards a biologically invasive and irreversible decision (full lower clearance for complete denture). However, as clinicians and experience with numerous patients failing to adapting to a complete lower denture, we were able to provide more information regarding partial transitional dentures. At the end of the day it is still the patient’s choice but it is our job to give them all the information to decide what is best for their own health. Good patient communication (breaking bad news) for the second appointment, and thorough clean debridement for the third. Last appointment, 27 with grade 3 mobility was extracted in a timely manner and delivered whole - thorough explanation of post-op care.\n",

Used teflon tape and clear strips to help with the shaping of the restoration which turned out nicely especially with the bevelling of the buccal surfaces to make it a smooth transition and improve bonding to perpendicular enamel rods. Generally happy with the end result although polishing took longer to achieve the finish I wanted, and have to be more carful with the use of the long needle bur. Second patient had a large facial swelling which had to be managed with extraction and antibiotics (spreading infection). To remember to give post op instructions to go to emergency if swelling causes difficulty breathing, although it was not the case at today's appointment (unilateral swelling). Use of intraligamentary LA technique was effective in addition to the IAN block and buccal infiltration. Positioning for Q3 exos are still a bit awkward, standing in front of the patient allows me to put wedging forces to luxate the tooth.\n",

      "Student Reflection: I believe I did very well during today's morning session at DTC as I was able to see two patients and complete treatment in the allotted time, suggesting continued improvement in my time management with patients. For the first patient, I completed a 16O restoration that I was able to complete independently with a great result. Something that I learned with my cavity prep was, although I was aiming to be conservative with the prep when the prep extended mesial due to the caries, I should have created more of a box on the mesio-occlusal aspect rather than a slope to ensure retention. Overall, the restoration went very well and the patient was happy. With the second patient, I completed a routine S/C + SRD. Everything went well, however I learned that when there are restorations, it often takes longer to debride as it is sometimes difficult to tell if there is a catch due to calculus or due to the restoration. However, in this case I repeatedly debrided the area until I was content with the result. Overall, I was able to complete treatment and manage my time really well with these patients as I was able to complete treatment + notes in the allotted appt time.\n",

      "Student Reflection: During today's afternoon session, I saw one patient for an extraction of the 46 as they require longer appointments as they are deaf and severely anxious. I had completed many extractions prior to this and was confident, however it was my first time completing an extraction where there was heavy decay and a cavitation on the buccal. My previous demonstrator warned me that there is a good chance this tooth may become surgical and will decoronate due to the decay. I did well with communicating and providing the patient LA and beginning luxation. I used the skills I had been taught by various demonstrators and luxated the MB, MidB and DB. I found difficulty luxating from the MidB as the tooth was cavitated and very decayed. I learned then in these cases, it is important to approach the mid buccal from the mesial and distal aspects at an angle rather than just the long axis of the tooth as it will be difficult to access. Moreover, it is important to ensure that the tip of my finger is at the tip of the luxator - I had been taught many different techniques from demonstrators regarding where to hold the luxator, but my demonstrator today had given a good explanation that if it does slip, it is entirely on the clinician in the real world and the patient's safety always comes first. I had achieved what I thought was grade II mobility and begun to use the lower hawks. My demonstrator explained that it is important to first engage the lingual as deep as I can and then the buccal furcation. I engaged the lingual, however on the buccal I had not completely engaged the furcation. As I was doing the figure 8 motion, the tooth decoronated due to the extent of the caries and due to me not engaging the buccal furcation completely. Next, the remaining tooth structure/roots did not appear to have much mobility and luxating the remaining structure was not doing much. This suggests that my initial luxation was not adequate as if it was, the whole tooth would be movile. My demonstrator explained that in this case, he ensured he engaged the lingual furcation and buccal furcation. As he approached the buccal, he made sure when he engaged the forceps that he bit away some of the bone to aid in removal. He explained this is similar to a surgical approach as they would remove bone in order to remove the tooth. Moreover, during the process I did begin to stress a bit after decoronation and when I was continuing to luxate I did make a sort of a grunting sound due to the extent of force I was using. It is important to remember that if a patient does hear this, it may make them more anxious and have less trust. The demonstrator also allowed me to reflect on deeper level on what I would do in this case if I were in the real world, rather than just thinking we can send the patient to PC. I explained that I would communicate what had happened to the patient and reassure them that the oral surgeon can complete the extraction and that there is nothing sinister occurring in the meantime. I learned an oral surgeon would not take the liability of seeing a patient right away especially if they are numb as they would not be able to confirm who is at fault if something went wrong prior. In this case, we would smooth down any sharp edges on the remaining tooth structure and prescribe the patient antibiotics for 1-2 days prior to seeing a surgeon where they can then complete their own assessment. Moreover, I learned the approach a surgeon would take with raising a flap in this case. I had some understanding of the type of flap and where they may approach it. However, my demonstrator explained that we must always be wary of the mental foramen and nerve when creating flaps. Overall, it was a great learning opportunity for a type of case I had not seen previously. I learned the importance of ensuring that we have optimal mobility and confirmation prior to placing forceps. \n",

      "Student Reflection: Today I was in PC for my rotation, in which I was also in during my first rotation. I had three patient's booked for me but the third patient FTAd so I saw two patients. The first patient came in due to a fracture of the 38DB temp resto as she is seeing the endo specialist for retreatment. I was able to independently take the correct history and conduct investigations of the lone standing 38. The fracture went subgingival so it was difficult placing a tofflemire band after multiple attempts as the tooth was very far back. Therefore, after consutling with my demonstrator we elected to restore it freehand with Fuji II. I believe the restoration went well as I was able to obtain a good marginal seal and create a functioning restoration. I learned that in some cases its important to assess whether we should spend more time trying to attempt to place the tofflemire or just elect to freehand as it can save time. Moreover, the second patient had a fracture of the 26DP which also had a DO amalgam resotration. The patient was very anxious and after communicating all options, the patient initially wanted to leave it and just focus on OHI, but after further conversation with my demo, the patient agreed to placing GIC without prepping any of the tooth. This patient had very tight contacts, so it was very difficult attempting to place a tofflemire band as it would not go through even with a wedge. My demonstrator taught me if this is the case, sometimes we can remove the tofflemire holder and just use the band and a wedge to restore. This was very helpful as I was able to place just the band and then get my DA to hold it around the DP aspect as I placed Fuji II. The resto went very well as I was able to obtain a good contact and seal with no catches after checking the contact with floss. The patient was very happy with the result. I believe this was a great learning opportunity as I learned different approaches of restoring teeth when we cannot place a tofflemire matrix band.\n",

      "Student Reflection: I believe I did very well during today's morning PC session as I saw three patients. I was able to independently investigate and communicate with patient one and extract their 22. This was relatively routine and I was able to complete it indepdentently. For the second pt I completed a 37O restoration that I completed well. I have learned many different things from different demos and today I was encouraged to use dycal + vitrebond due to deep caries. The last patient was a limited exam as the pt felt pain on the 11 and 21. She was missing posterior teeth and does not wear her denture. I learned that although sometimes may indicate some form of pulpitis, in this case her traumatic bite may be causing her issues as all the force is on the anterior teeth. We took the conservative approach of sending her to DTC for a new denture.\n",

Partner did a 24 extirpation, however the tooth ended up with a poor prognosis due to extent of caries - pt elected to keep it and extirpate.

      "Student Reflection: During today's afternoon session I saw two patients. For the first pt, I was able to take a thorough medical history as the patient had a number of conditions including diabetes + radiation therapy/chemotherapy. After conducting my investigations, the 48 was elected to be extracted. I was able to independently provide good LA and complete this in a quick and efficient manner as the tooth was already mobile. I was able to luxate until it was completely mobile and just use forceps to grasp the tooth and take it out. The patient was very happy with the result. \n",
      "\n",
      "For the second pt, they had an abscess on the 12 that was causing them severe pain. It was my first time incising and draining an abscess and I learned many things. I already knew that it can be difficult for LA to be effective but I learned that it can be difficult as there is a lot of pressure, when injecting as I felt some initial resistance. I learned that we can give LA around in and around the abscess to ensure the pt is numb. I learned that when we use the scalpel for an abscess on the buccal aspect, we make a 0.5 mm incision just below the abscess for the pus to drain. Moreover, it was my first time hearing of the molt instrument and I learned how to use it to drain more pus. I learned what to feel for in swelling cases as if it is soft it is just inflammation and we can describe it as oedematous where as if it is hard or flucuant it is pus build up localized to that area. In this case it was firm under the right nostril and oedematous under the eye. I was able to feel the difference after drainage as initially it was firm and then after drainage it was much softer. Overall, it was a great learning experience.\n",

For my second patient, I completed a base metal onlay prep on the 16, tooth secondary impressions and bite reg, and temporised the tooth. I did have difficulty with this prep as it was deep sub-gingival on the D aspect and very close to the furcation point. With me demonstrator's assistance, I was able to better understand how to overcome such challenges – effective use of retraction cords and creating a DO box to enhance retention features will ensure that the overall prep is retentive. \n",

      "Student Reflection: Today I restored 22DB and 21DB using GIC. It was a relatively simple restoration, however the main challenge was managing the patient's caries risk. The carious lesion extended from the crown to the root, therefore I was not able to use a rubber dam and had to find other means to maintain moisture control.  The 21 also had grade 1 mobility, so I had to be sure to be careful not to cause further mobility during the restoration. Overall i think the procedure went well. I would like to improve on my ability to recreate morphology, as I was not able to accurately recreate the bulbosity of the crown, so that it can be easily distinguished from the root. \n",

I had to explain every step of the appointment to the patient, beginning with where to sit in the chair, what I was looking for, what to expect for the exam, what to expect when taking a radiograph, etc. I had to explain in great detail what the patient's options were for this given tooth to ensure they understood their options. This tooth also had roots in very close proximity to the adjacent molar which mean it may involve a surgical extraction or more complicated root canal. It was difficult to the leave the patient in pain without providing help, but it was necessary to reduce risk as much as possible.\n",

The third molar was extracted in one piece, however the second molar decoronated and became a surgical extraction. This was a very difficult extraction requiring assistance from the demonstrator. Due to the proximity to the IAN, it was determined that it was best to leave the roots in situ and refer to oral surgeon.

I learned that it is important to discuss this as a risk especially when caries are visible clinically and radiographically under a crown. I also learned that it is best to wait to re-cement the crown or do any other restorative work after an extraction to 1) reduce risk of dry socket and 2) achieve optimal moisture control. When using the forceps for delivery, I learned to use the radiograph to help with the movements that should be used (i.e., due to the proximity of the adjacent tooth, delivery would be easier distobuccally).\n",

      "Student Reflection: Today's session was quite difficult as the patient arrived over 20 minutes late. There were also a lack of DAs throughout the session that made it difficult to get through steps of the procedure in a timely manner. Along with this, the patient informed me at the beginning of the appointment that she is unable to stay for the full length of the appointment. The plan was to complete RCT on the 24, however due to time restraints I aimed to complete working length and instrumentation. However, during working length determination using the electronic apex locator, there was difficulty initially with the machine, and then with negotiating the canal. I had to ask the demonstrator for help, however there were curvatures noted at the tips of the hand files while trying to gain a reading. Eventually H-file #10 fractured in the buccal canal while the demonstrator was trying to determine the working length. A periapical radiograph was taken and the patient was informed of the fracture/risks and that a specialist referral would be completed. The patient was very understanding of this, however, this was the first time I've had to have this conversation with a patient which was quite stressful. \n",

However, following a second and third opinion today, the demonstrators suggested to try restoring the fractured teeth in an attempt to save them. The patient was happy to continue with this and I ended up doing a 24MODB resin composite build-up which was quite difficult, in terms of tofflemire placement, isolation, and building up the tooth. It turned out okay in the end, however, I could have built up the buccal cusp more. This was a great learning experience as I was able to consider different options for the patient and can see whether the patient's function can be restored. The second patient required a 13MB restoration. This was more straightforward however I could have been better with time management.\n",

Needed help with endofrost and was quick to presume that the patient's tooth is non-vital without doing any pulp testing. Need to work a little faster. \n",
      "Edu Feedback: Very large missing filling, no caries. Need to check vitiality before formulating a treatment plan. Using endofrost - don't use a cotton bud as they are wound too tightly and don't get cold enough and are therefore likely to give false negatives. when building up a very large filling on a tooth where there is not enough tooth structure remaining to securely hold a matrix band, can build up some areas freehand first to give you something to support the matrixband. Need to have very good moisture control to do this and an assistant that is able to help you as much as possible.\n",

      "- Need to improve my posture and technique when performing extraction. Ensure that I use the 3-finger system for future extractions: 1 finger (index finger) on the buccal surface of the intended tooth, 1 finger (middle finger) on the lingual surface of the intended tooth, and 1 finger (thumb) supporting the jaw. Also remind patient to keep the chin up so that I can have a better field of view. Ensure that I am standing firmly on my feet and not leaning forward. I should also ensure that my fingers are firmly planted so that they do not slide forward. \n",
      "\n",
      "PA: I should always have the PA of the intended extraction tooth when performing the extraction. Having the PA allows me to visualize the anatomy of the root tips and helps with selection of instrument (i.e. today I used the cowhorn because of the generally long and straight root anatomy that can be lifted with the cowhorn mechanism). Also without the PA, I wouldn't be able to catch the slight distal kink of the mesial root and I might have fractured the root tip when I am using too much force with the forcep. \n",

      "Also learned a lot from the supervisor about the usage of Luxator and Elevator. For luxator, I should do gentle rotation aiming to get the luxator as apically as possible around the buccal and mesial buccal surfaces. For elevator, I should gently wedge the luxator (Couplands) into the mesial interproximal areas, and gently rotate upwards to lift up the tooth. I should do delicate and gentle strokes that do not require brute force, and I should visualize inspect for signs of tooth movement. During the last stage, I used the cowhorn forcep and gently wedged the forcep into the furcation area. I learned to perform gentle figure of 8 motion with my wrist because of the distal kink of the mesial root of 36, and be gentle and slowly increase the range of my motions to not break the root tip. Remember to avoid sudden, jerking motion with my forcep to not break the root tip. \n",
      "Edu Feedback: Always have the PA up on your screen when doing extractions, and keep referring to it as you do your extraction. make sure the chair is positioned so you can keep your back straight and see well. use gentle motions when luxating to avoid breaking the roots. You are aiming to gently tease the tooth out of the socket. when the roots have a distal curvature an couplands can be really helpful to elevate the tooth along the curvature of the root\n",

Learned to not be afraid of seperating tooth at furcation if it is very broken down to deliver roots individually. The 46 was previously endo treated and had a metal post. Learned how to keep pt calm \"don't be scared of the funny noises\". Pt #3 learned about how to talk to patients re importance of crowning endo treated molar teeth. Learned when to leave a restoration and when to remove. Identified craze lines and reduced occlusal load. Pt #4 learned how to create a flap, remove bone, and surgically remove a 46 with curved roots. Observed how to suture thin gingival biotype and panadeine forte post-op instructions.\n",

      "SO Feedback: Pt 1. Other students did the exam and investigations but this appt was supposed to make the tx plan. Usually trying to look back in the notes from previous appts is unhelpful because there is not enough information, whereas in this case there was too much information and lots of it didn’t match the charting. You can tell they were trying to be comprehensive and follow the process we were taught for exams, discussion, listing tx options and risks but it just makes it really difficult to pick out pertinent information (which I myself have been guilty of doing in the past as well so I don’t blame them but I just think we haven’t been able to figure out how to simplify this process yet) so my partner basically redid the exam while I helped read out what was documented in the file to cross check everything. The patient ends up with a comprehensive treatment plan which is the goal so that is good but unfortunately sometimes the discontinuity of care during rotations ends up being a waste of patient time and public resources. \n",

I was able to use my communication skills to try and relax the patient, however, he still needed frequent breaks which resulted in the procedure taking longer than expected. To improve on this, I can be better at locating caries and being more efficient with my caries removal by extending my prep to allow for easier removal. This will be incorporated at my next procedure. \n",

To improve, I can me mindful on instead of extending the prep mesial and deep, instead go buccal and palatal to visualize the caries. Also, I will. be mindful of placing the wooden wedge with the matrix band to ensure a better contour of the matrix band.\n",

      "For the final patient, I was happy with the finished overall restoration. However, I was happy with my problem-solving/trouble-shooting as there was a void present on the MB margin. I was able to place flowable and ensure a good seal. However, to avoid this happening in future, I can ensure to place my increments in such a manner that there are no voids present. I can do this by building the mesial wall first, or place increments in a diagonal manner. I will use these tips to make the restoration more efficient in future appointments. \n",

      "Cavity prep - needed some direction but overall you did well. You did extend the prep too much and broke through the gingival floor which is why there was excessive haem. Need to be mindful. With smaller restorations, especially for deciduous dentition, the caries normally is at or just under the contact and can be more palatal or buccal. In this case it was more towards the palatal just under the contact. So I would recommend extending the prep just under the contact and opening it up bunco-palatally to see the caries extent to avoid going through the floor. \n",

As a result of this, they are subjected to repeat procedures (ie. Medical History Questionnaires).

Case 2 involved investigating a root treated tooth and deciding the best course of action. It highlighted discussing various options with the patients including referrals for specialist treatment. Patient 3 involved a chronic periodontal abscess. This was informative as the patient still wished to retain the tooth despite it having 90-100% bone loss and having an abscess. Therefore, this was a good reminder in treating the patient as a whole rather than just a dental issue\n",

      "Student Reflection: Pt 1: exam for a pt with a complex history (domestic violence, schizophrenia, low pain tolerance). This was a good exercise in providing care cognisant of the person as a whole. I had to ensure I was sensitive to her previous experiences and also not to trigger her. I felt I was able to provide her the support and comfort in the chair. Scaling was difficult as the patient has signifciant plaque/calculus deposits however her low pain threshold made it difficult to continue. However the patient left pleased with her care which made me feel accomplished \n",
      "Pt 2: Emergency. This patient presented with a necrotic tooth but no obvious caries or crack. I felt I became flustered trying to determine the diagnosis as the signs/symptoms werent so obvious that I could easily diagnose the situation. As a result I made tx recommendations that were not ideal including a referral to the RDHM for a tooth that has a poor prognosis. I have learnt that it is important to balance the patients expectations and what I think is the best choice. \n",
      "Edu Feedback: need to work on improving diagnosis and accurately coming up with a tx plan that has a more holistic approach. pt communication can be improved by being more concise and clear.\n",

      "Student Reflection: Today's cons appointment ran smoothly. The restoration was adjacent to an existing amalgam, so attention should be placed to add retention features as there is limited bonding to amalgam with resin composite, e.g. with a dove-tail. Additionally, taking intra-oral photos to record the status of soft-tissue lesions should always be considered, and today's patient served as a reminder to do so. Finally, remembering to check all margins of the final restoration to ensure a smooth and cleanseable surface is always required, especially when packable resin composite is used with Tofflemire bands.\n",

It turned out that the hot water was used prior, so even though the cold water tap was turned on, warm water still came out which made the alginate set faster. Awareness of this - especially by ensuring the water temperature is checked - will assist in the future. Additionally, ensuring good buccal tissue manipulation during the impression will ensure better border moulding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, today's appointment was a good lesson in patient-directed treatment planning. For instance, the last patient had only 6 teeth left, with 2 being grade 2 mobile. Though the treatment options were explained, the patient opted for no treatment and no dentures being made due to poor past denture experience. Though I attempted to explain why the patient potentially experienced the difficulties with the dentures in the past, the patient preferred to leave their teeth alone and see how long they last. Even without teeth, the patient felt that they could eat alright, and no one even notices that he doesn't have teeth. Keeping patient opinions and past experience in mind when treatment planning, even if I wouldn't necessarily choose that treatment option, is incredibly important and this appointment reinforced this notion. As long as the patient is fully aware of all options and their associated costs and benefits, the patient is always free to choose the option they feel is best for them.\n",

For instance, a patient who had a spreading infection as a result of a carious tooth was concerned with the gap that would be left behind after the tooth was taken out. Even though there was significant pain and some swelling, the patient was unwilling to have the tooth taken out without an immediate replacement option in place. As a result, the exo was postponed to later next week when an immediate denture is ready. This case emphasised to me the importance of holistic dental care - even though it may be clinically advisable to remove the tooth immediately, it is still important to consider the patient's context and their entire experience, i.e. aesthetic concerns, lifestyle concerns and psychosocial wellbeing. As such, it is paramount to combine this picture to provide patient-centred care.\n",

      "Pt 3 was more difficult with the cavity preparation. This cavity was fairly extensive and there was a carious pulp exposure. In hindsight, I should have known to stop drilling with the slow speed closer to the pulp but the caries was extremely deep. I now know the anatomy better for root caries lesions and the steps to take when doing a direct pulp cap. Overall, a good learning experience and one to do better next time.\n",

In the period after morning tea, there were a number of exos and restorations done for patients. I got to hone in my skills at anterior restorations, which I enjoy doing.

It is always good experience to watch other clinicians and I look forward to my next day as operator!\n",

It was weird using a different system than the one we use at DTC, but it was good to adapt to a different system. I was happy with my timing and the end result. We also had a number of extractions today. I feel confident in my abilities in simple extractions and feel that I can apply the same principles to any tooth that comes my way. We learned a lot about pt's taking aspirin and how to manage those that bleed heavily. Lastly, we had a review for a toothache and in the first visit a few weeks ago, the signs and symptoms were leading us towards the route of RCT/Exo but the clinical examination of the tooth gave a different picture. We decided to stay conservative and it was good to hear that we could relieve pain without doing something irreversible. Overall, a good day and I was very happy with the time management.\n",

Various patient cases came in, ranging from those that required crown recementation, exo and pulpal extirpation. By assisting Hakan today, I was able to learn how to effectively improve my time management to manage pt quicker. He was able to ask direct questions to quickly identify diagnosis and rapidly discuss treatment options and gain consent to proceed with procedure without wasting time. This was my biggest takeaway and something I plan to incorporate into my own practice.\n",

All patients I saw today required either a simple or surgical exo, to which the surgical exos were referred to qualified dentists on level 1. I was able to efficiently complete limited exam and special investigations and conduct exos mostly independently. There was the third case, which has bulbous mesial and distal roots for tooth 36. This was a difficult extraction, however I was able to use combined luxation and forcep delivery to extract the tooth without the need for surgical exo and extract it in one piece. My fourth patient came in with a comprehensive medical history, including kidney dialysis, immunocompromised and multiple surgeries. He is also a falls risk, so I was able to learn how to fill a falls risk assessment form and take the steps to refer to GP to manage. I was also able to learn how to provide antibiotic prophylaxis and how to write a script up on titanium.\n",

I learnt that for a heavily broken down 22, other than using just a tofflemire matrix to build the bulk of the restoration, we can use a plastic mylar strip and just hold it in place with out hands to build the palatal wall and restore the distal angle in increments. Today, I was abe to observe how a surgical exo is conducted. It was interesting to observe how to raise a sulcus flap on the buccal aspect for tooth 46 exo and use a surgical handpiece for create a gutter to assist in surgical exo of the 46. I also was able to observe the technique to suture using plain gut suture. I was able able to observe how Dr Reem provides postop exo instructions to the patient and incorporate her approach to providing postop instructions. Another thing was that I was able to learn how to take into consideration the option of providing post-core crown to be done in private for the pt to consider to salvage their tooth.

      "Student Reflection: Had a varied clinical day today. First time sectioning a tooth, which went smoothly. Initally for this tooth, it was difficult gripping the tooth due to heavily breaking down of tooth structure. Sectioning a tooth mesio distally, allows for greater room for the tooth to be luxated, towards the centre of the tooth which increased ease of extraction. 3 Extractions were performed today, in which towards the end of the day, where confidence in luxation technique increased throughout the day. The restoration, 17B was difficult due to hypomineralisation of the buccal, which had a crumbly texture, in which the restoration had to be extended to sound tooth structure. \n",

      "Student Reflection: The first patient had a very old denture that needed to be remade but they are still on the waitlist so I took an impression to reline the denture which is something I haven't done before. The second patient had a previous restoration done 2021 which had partially fractured off. It needed minimal prep and I rebuilt it shorter to try to ensure it wouldn't happen again as it was in heavy contact. I reduced the enamel nearby on the same cusp but not enough so need to ensure I reduce high spots to prevent another fracture. The third patient had a very large restoration that had come out leaving behind the RCT with a buccal wall only. I struggled to place the Tofflemire here as the distal portion went equigingival with some recession. I went ahead with the restoration knowing the distal had a small gap and wish I didn't because it wasn't sitting properly and some of the cavity prep didn't get included and then had to be redone. I also should have built the tooth up higher covering the buccal cusps, as I only placed about 1mm of RC on the cusps which then was polished off. I also thought I needed to keep the restoration out of occlusion due to the significant tooth loss but perhaps should have built it up into light occlusion given it was a RC resto not GIC. The fourth patient needed multiple exos completed, however today I did the 34. I wasn't feeling very well and struggled to get through this session. Coming to a dx took way longer than it should have however the exo went smoothly with Dr Sheryl guiding me as it was my first exo. The final pt was the same as the first for their reline, it fitted much better than before and needed minimal adjustment. Overall it was a long day but I learnt a lot and hope I can consolidate my theory and put it to practice over the next 2 weeks here.\n",

      "Student Reflection: Today my first patient had a simple 11 incisal restoration which I was able to restore easily, however I had to adjust the occlusion quite a lot as the patient had a functional shift when biting into and edge to edge pattern which meant a heavier occlusion on the tooth. The second pt arrived for exam however had F/F and was happy with them so no treatment was needed. The third patient FTA'd. The fourth patient needed a large restoration on the 25 where it had fractured off. I removed the entire restoration except for one of the pins and restored the tooth around it. I didn't have trouble with the restoration, however I had a lot of trouble with fitting the denture back on as the tooth had changed shape. I think my reducing was very tentative as I didn't want to lose the retention of the denture, however this meant it took a long time. From this session I learnt to be a little more aggressive with both old composite removal such as around the pins as if the pins come out then they weren't going to help with retention anyway. I also ideally would be more confident with adjusting the final composite to fit the denture so it doesn't take quite so long.\n",

The 12 was simple however I needed some help with the first canine. I wasn't using enough force when using the forceps but was able to then implement this with the 23 and exo the tooth myself. The 16 looked simple on the radiograph and not near the sinus, however it turned out the roots were curved and likely against the sinus, but not OAC thankfully. The third patient I was a bit overwhelmed by all the reasons for presenting and knew I didn't have much time. I also found this really complex as she had a very small mouth and trying to access the 27B was very difficult. Thankfully Dr Alice showed me how to get the patient to move their bottom over and then half close their mouth to gain more access. The second restoration the 25 was very deep and I was worried about pulpal exposure. I learnt about TheraCal and placed it over the pulp exposure, then used V3 matrix to restore the tooth. I feel that I went way too slow with this tooth and want to be more confident with deep restorations.\n",
      "Edu Feedback: - lower anterior fillings, would have  been sensible to complete 41 D while working in the areas. silly to select. trimmed that tooth a little, fine because we will be filling NV. access- gotta give yourself space to work or you'll miss caries. \n",

      "Student Reflection: Today I saw 2 patients. The first had a missing restoration 11DP and caries 11M. I completed 2 restorations which I felt took too long. The cavity preparation was quick however the composite and finishing it took a lot longer. I wasn't completely happy with the shape of the mesial edge as it wasn't as curved as I would have liked. The second patient only had 3 lower anteriors for an exam and 2 carious lesions, however was only booked for an exam. I sometimes forget here that the sessions are shorter and try to get too much done in one session. I was also very cautious with the patient as he was very frail and needed antibiotic prophylaxis for treatment which I haven't experienced before. In the afternoon I was DA/obs of Dr Alice first completing a surgical extraction which was really good to observe as I haven't seen one before. The second pt was an exam wanting aesthetic cons work.\n",
