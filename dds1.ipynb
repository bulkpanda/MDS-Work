      "student_feedback havent finished restoration. sealant application went well and so did cavity prep. i had to drill a lot deeper than i anticipated so i spent quite a lot of time being conservative, but felt quite comfortable switching between handpieces to create a good prep. buccolingual length of the prep was a bit big, but mesiodistal was good. with the restoration, i got all the way up to the polishing, but found that there were small circular imprints on the restoration. im not sure if these are from the ball bearing when i was applying the resin, or the tips of the polishing burs and i didnt cure the resin for long enough to set it properly. otherwise everything was pretty good\n",

As a dental assistant, I personally have seen dental dam application in close view, however, I was always scared that the dental dam might come off, or uncomfortable to patients. When doing the isolation, I felt like it was easier than expected, and found it easier if I attached the clamp onto the dental dam before applying to manikins. I found anchoring the frame to the dental dam but after several of practice, I found that more stretch is required to secure the frame to the dam. I learnt that distancing the holes is important to ensure proper coverage of teeth by the dam. I felt like I am more confident with applying dental dam and was generally satisfied with my progress.\n",

I learnt that pressure control with high speed handpiece is important as I made a small pit that wasnt intended.

      "student_feedback I completed my first Fisher sealant and tooth restoration today with my demonstrator Jenny Liu. A take away from this is that the etch needs to be left for 30-60 seconds rather than the usual 20-30 seconds when working on prepped cavitations as there is no exposed collagen tubules and thus takes longer to work on the enamel. Only a very very small amount of fisher sealant is required, much less than you would think you would need. It took me a while to get a preparation right. Jenny gave me feedback that I was being way too conservative. After gaining some confidence using both the high speed and low speed hand pieces. I understood the function of the pear-shaped bur in the high speed hand piece. I was shown to push the bur sideways to extend the access of the restoration. _x000D_\n",
      "What took the longest time was the smoothing. I found it challenging to smooth out the the internal margins and floor of the preparation cavity. I learnt that the base of the restoration prep also needs to be smooths out and that they should not be any enamel unsupported as that will lead to fracturing when under pressure. My demonstrator showed me a tip that i can pack the resin into the cavitation on angled increments mimicking the angulation of the cusp angles, making it easier to create an anatomically correct fissure system on the occlusal system. _x000D_\n",

The one challenging thing about this task was knowing if I had used excessive primer and bond, and determining if the solvent of the primer had been evaporated. Adding sealant and finishing and polishing the restoration are the next steps that I still need to do. \n",

      "student_feedback I was really excited to begin this activity and officially kickstart the practical aspect of this subject. I chose the clamp based on the guide on the front of my clamp pack (I chose W7 initially for the isolation of the 36) and used this for both the benchtop and first manikin exercise. I didn't struggle too much with punching the dam, putting the clamp through the hole, or putting the clamp on the tooth, but I found it slightly difficult to then stretch the dam around the tooth and to bring the beaks of the clamp above the dam (as it was wingless and was initially under the dam). I also found that I was pinching the mesial gingiva quite a bit with the W7 clamp, so for Task 5 I ended up swapping to the 13A winged clamp and found this much easier for me. During Task 5, I also found that I punched the holes in the dam too close for the anterior teeth as I had trouble flossing all the material through in this area, which caused some microtears. However I didn't have this problem in the posterior areas so I believe the holes were appropriately spaced apart here. I attempted all three methods of secondary retention and found the floss ligature the easiest for me - I would ideally have liked to use the wedjet but I could not get it through the contact and broke it twice before I moved onto the floss, but I will try this again next session. I then found it slightly difficult to invert the dam at times as it was wrapped very tightly around each tooth and the flat plastic didn't seem thin enough to fit in between, but I got there in the end._x000D_\n",
      "My main takeaways from the tasks today are to take my time so that I minimise tears, pay attention to the clamp contact points of the tooth to ensure proper isolation, and to think about spacing the holes apart appropriately based on which teeth are being isolated. Overall I really enjoyed today's session and I also feel like I learned a lot about my manual dexterity - I am looking forward to continuing preclinical sessions next week.\n",

The most difficult and tedious part was placing the holes over the rest of the teeth without tearing the dam. I unfortunately did make some small tears at the borders of some holes. I believe that was because I did not punch the holes accurately into the dam (they were slightly off centred), so I need to make sure I mark the holes properly with the dam securely on the template.

      "student_feedback Though the dental dam procedure proved challenging, I really enjoyed being able to put into practice what I had learnt from the videos and lectures. Some things I can improve on include making sure my bracket table was set up with all the dental instruments I needed to use including the mirror (for inverting the dam) and scissors (for snipping dam after use). This setup enables me to ensure I don’t need to go back to the desk as I am completing the procedure. Also, I need to remember which quadrants I am working on, remembering that we count from the patient’s perspective. This is really important to ensure I am isolating and working on the correct teeth. I also learnt how to invert the dental dam, by either guiding my flat plastic around the gingival margin of the tooth, or gently probing it so that it inverts towards the gingiva. I have to ensure I use the mirror to invert the lingual surface of the mandibular teeth too! I also found putting on the clamp was a bit fiddly, but my demonstrator helped guide me and gave me some advice to stretch the dental dam over the clamp, and this was really helpful! Also, for the floss ligature, I need to ensure it’s tightened all the way to the cervical constriction of the tooth! I also missed a hole, so wasn’t able to isolate one tooth - next time, I will ensure to count each tooth correctly and include a midline mark on the dental dam to help with my orientation.

I also learnt a lot regarding the overall process of how we open the 'access' with the high-speed handpiece (used for enamel), and then use the slow-speed handpiece for smoothing the edges and removing the caries. Slow-speed handpieces should be used to 80-100% of their max speed, whereas high-speed handpieces run only at one set speed. Overall, I think I achieved a very good cavity prep.

I also learnt a lot regarding the overall process of how we open the 'access' with the high-speed handpiece (used for enamel), and then use the slow-speed handpiece for smoothing the edges and removing the caries. Slow-speed handpieces should be used to 80-100% of their max speed, whereas high-speed handpieces run only at one set speed. Overall, I think I achieved a very good cavity prep. Next time, I will finish it off with the polishing and finishing. \n",

For the cavity outline, the lingual wall was a little flared. Otherwise, I thought the internal surfaces are smooth and there is no unsupported enamel. To correct the flared wall, I will run along the deeper surface of that side to even it out. For the small occlusion restoration, I am happy I completed it well under the guideline.

There was no excess of resin composite in the cavity (maybe a little little bit more can be applied).

In my final attempt, I became frustrated when the clamps weren't fitting as I liked. I was also frustrated that I did not adjust dam hole sizes to fit the each tooth. I therefore developed tunnel vision, and only focused on the parts that were frustrating me. This lead me to forget some basics (i.e.wing beak exposure/oral cavity coverage). In the future, I hope to remind myself of the basics throughout the exercise. \n",

      "student_feedback The fissure sealing was very enjoyable and ran smoothly. The Small cavity prep on the other hand was quite challenging. In an effort to smoothen the margins, I would accidentally create the prep deeper and larger. This created rougher edges that meant I had to continue smoothening the margins. In the end, my prep-margins were too large. Next time I hope to be more conservative. I also struggled with the composite curing in ambient light. This meant that there was a rough finish in the end. \n",

      "student_feedback I found today quite challenging but equally super enjoyable, it was a new skill and having more restricted motion with my left hand due to a broken finger made things a little more difficult. I was very luck to have Dr Chong teaching me not only was he very supportive he also gave me some very helpful tips that didn't come up in the lectures. I found at times things weren't going as planned and I would have to restart so I would begin to rush. I think I need to change the way I approach these tasks speed will come with practice but for my first ever attempt its ok to take things slow and learn the correct technique. A few take aways were stretching the distal and mesial parts before clamping the tooth, this makes a massive difference and I found less folding and it made it much easier to floss these aspects. Additionally I have to remember to go over the wings and invert the dam over the clamp, this was a step I forgot a couple of times so I should make more of a conscious effort. Additionally I noticed that using my hand to put the dam over the teeth for a multiple tooth isolation made things a lot easier before going over it with floss. Overall I think I need a lot more practice, so I will be taking my set home to practice before the next class. Dr Chong was always very encouraging this made a massive difference to be honest I always felt motivated to try again and push forward even when things went south. Even the simple acts of him checking in as I was working reminded me that help was always around and to keep working hard. I actually really enjoyed this class probably one of my favourites so far even though I didn't do great. I want to try securing the multiple tooth isolation with a clamp and floss I only tried the wedjet. This is probably something I can do at home. I found my dam would somtimes tear in the multiple tooth isolation I think this issue came from punching the holes too close next time around I want to experiment a bit with the positions or even the size of the hole punch I think it will make a big difference and hopefully lead to less tears. In regards to my positioning I need to remember the dam is there to cover the mouth and isolate the teeth so make sure always before I ask Dr Chong to check that its performing that purpose. There was one time a called him over and the maxillary incisors were exposed... whoops. \n",

I think my restorations need improvement especially when putting in composite I tend to put in excess, also the first time I did it the composite had already set so I have to be more mindful to cover it when I am not using it. Additionally I think I need to be more mindful of where I am drilling I drilled too deep during the prep and as a consequence had to drill deep everywhere else.

      "student_feedback Fissure sealants were done quite well. For the small occlusal cavity prep, I began drilling more towards the lingual aspect of the tooth and didn’t see any coloured dye indicating caries. The first entry was cut a little deeper than I wanted, so the cavity depth reflected more than the extent of the caries ( now I know for next time to slowly create the access hole so that doesn't happen again. Dr. Phu encouraged that I open my cavity prep more towards the buccal aspect, and I did end up finding the caries. I struggled to remove all the caries at the DEJ, and I swear it was never-ending. I took my time making sure that the cavity walls were all smooth. The cavity prep was definitely on the bigger side due to my early error, but I felt very proud of it in the end. After the restoration was cured, I didn’t finish polishing the occlusal surface, so the final product couldn’t be assessed. Overall, I think it went quite well, and I appreciate that I took the time to complete each step and didn’t rush through. \n",

      "student_feedback It did not go too well. When using high speed bur, I broke it right away and soon learned from Dr. Dai that it should be one motion in and out. Do not stop pedal when bur is inside the tooth!! The bur angle should be 90 degrees to the tooth surface. Also, I couldn’t figure out where the caries was, so I went a bit distal compared to the caries position. This also resulted in my cavity depth being beyond the extent of caries! It went into the dentine! As I only figured out the caries was more medial quite late, the access at that point was huge, but I could still see caries. To clean that up, I had to open the access even more and remove. There were still unsupported enamel due to my bad angular ion of slow speed but which created a gouge underneath the mesiobuccal cusp. The access was so big at this point that removing anymore just destroyed the tooth. As I moved on to next parts, I had a hard time with filling the composite increment. As the access was too big, I didn’t know how much was enough. Combined with time rush, I wasn’t be able to do as much as I wished. Dr. Bhide showed me how to fill up the margins and smoothed them out. I also needed to remember to take my burs out after using! I did improve and remember my finger test which I struggled last week. Overall, without the help of Dr. Bhide and Dr. Dai, this could have been even worse. It was a learning journey, and I’m sure these mistakes will teach me how to do better next week!\n",

      "student_feedback I took too long trying to get the calmp around the tooth 44 hole on the dental dam for the multiple teeth isolation. The spacing of the holes in the dental dam was off, might have been due to rushing to get one attempt at a multiple teeth isolation. On the note of rushing, I shouldn't be rushing procedures, I just wanted to see if i could do the multiple teeth isolation in the remaining time. Single tooth isolation was fine, just lacking in lubriacation to make things slide a bit easier into place. Single tooth isolation was singificantly easier, there is alot more room for potential erros in the multiple tooth isolation (dam tearing around one of the teeth, punching one hole improperly). My bracket table was a mess, I need to have better management of that in future sessions. I need to work on my grip strength, I did not have the easiest time punching holes through the dental dam. Surprisingly, I only had one tear due to me rushing the multiple tooth isolation, in addiiton to miscounting which tooth I was on. I may practice the multiple teeth isolation outside of lab times, as a bench exerice,  to refine my techinqie, seeing as I was unable to complete it during my session.\n",
