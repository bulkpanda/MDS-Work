NSAIDs are the best chocie as they inhibit cox-1 and cox-2 which decreases prostaglandins and in turn decreases pain, inflammation and fevers.<br/><br/>other reasons<br/><br/>* Mr AB does not need celecoxiv (a selective NSAID for only inhibiting cox-2), as it does not directly outline that he has a risk of GI ulcers (although smoking can increase risk of GI ulcers, but is not a direct cause).<br/><br/>* Mr AB also doesnt have a contraindication/allergy to NSAIDs hence it's appropriate to use.\n",

(6 Marks)B. Cindy is 5 and needs and extraction of the 54. She has buccal facial swelling.Would this Impact the onset and effectiveness of local anaesthesia at this site. why/why not? (4 marks) with answer: A)An RHS IAN block aims to target the inferior alveolar nerve, and anesthetise the innervated tissues of lower right hand side teeth and soft tissue (excluding pulp of molar and buccal soft tissue adjacent to molars). The target site for injection would have been superior to the lingula, in which diffusion of the anaesethtic solution would act. As identified, the patient had attained symptoms of Bell's palsy, in which paralysis of the facial muscles would have occured, due to incorrect LA technique. The clinician would have injected anaestethtic too posteriorly, diffusing near the parotid gland, and the nerves that innervate the facial muscles. Initially, the clinciain should ensure that the patient is given an eye patch on the RHS eye to prevent dryness, and re-assure patient that the symtoms would continue for the duration of action of the anaestehtic for soft tissues of approx 3 hours, in which they should contact the clinic if paralysis ensues after that time. For future references, the clinician should focus on the correct landmarks such as the lingula, and maintaining correct depths of injection of approx 25mm, and ensuring he contacts the bone before continuing injetion of the solution.<br/><br/><br/><br/>B) Facial swelling is usually a result of acute inflammation, resulting in increased blood flow, increased acidity/lower pH of fluids in tissue. As the LA solution has a pka value that is slightly basic in pH, maximum effectiveness of anaestesia would be a neutral pH. In the case of the buccal swelling the lower pH of the tissues decreases the effectiveness of the anaestethic solution as more of the solution is ionised, and less solutions is able to pass through the sodium channels of the nerves. Therefore, the dosage and thius cartridges of anaestehtic would be required to achive anaestehtsia of the tissue.<br/><br/>\n",

Water can decrease concentration of acids thus decreasing pH, and reduce demineralisation of hard tissues. Can also act to reduce bacterial load by \"washing\" bacteria away.<br/><br/>-Mucin + water: Can also acts to hydrate and lubircate soft tissue in mouth, reducing damage caused by friction.<br/><br/>-Proteins: can assist with wound healing of soft tissue by supplying additional proteins.

The progression of demineralisation of enamel can be influenced by which factors? 5 marks with answer: A)<br/><br/>Flouride is a ion that replaces the two calcium atoms contained within hydroxyapatite crystals through a chemical reaction. This results in the formation of flurohydroxyapatite, which has a lower critical pH of approx 3.5 instead of 5.5 in which demineralisation can occur. As flouride has a lower electronegativieity, a higher concentration of acids is required to demineralise flouriohydroxyapatite, having implications by resisting and reducing the rate of demineralisation on the hard tissue.<br/><br/><br/><br/>B)<br/><br/>-Duration of acid exposure: having more time exposed to a lower ph could result in a longer time under the critical ph of 5.5, resulting in increased demineralisation. CLinical application: consuming dietary sugars between meals, more time for bacteria to anaerobically ferment sugars resulting in bacterial acid, exposing enamel to more acids causing demineralisation.<br/><br/>-Temperature: if enamel is exposed to acid of a higher temperature, the demineralisation reaction occurs quicker than that of a colder enviroment. Clinical application: drinking cold soda would be preferred over warm as less demineralisation of enamel occurs.<br/><br/>-Lack of buffering and remineralisation capacity: patient does not produce enough saliva to buffer acids and remineralise hard tissue.<br/><br/>-Enamel streucture: Hypomineralised enamel strcuture containing less hydroxyapapaite such as in hypoplastic teeth, demineralise at a faster rate due to less inorganic strcuture that reduces rate of demineralisation.\n",

This should resolve as the anaesthesia wears off (duration of action- 3-4hrs), if it does not resolve in over 8 hours to contact the clinican or refer/emergency if unavailble or symptoms change. Also provide standard post opertaive instruction for a restoration/anaesthesia.<br/><br/>B)<br/><br/>The duration of local anaesthesia action is greatly effected by the injection site vascularity. As local anaesthisa is asborsed systemically and metabolised. Tissue inflammation/swelling occurs to increase blood flow to site, when anasethsia is injected it is rapidly cleared increasing systemic abosprtion. Therefore its duration of action is reduced and risk of tocity increase (as high levels in the blood).<br/><br/>Furthermore, if the swelling is also associated with infecion/inflammation the pH of the site is likely lowered.

The implant also looks stable on the radiograph as it hasnt moved out of position, still remains straight and intact with bone. There are no dark shadows or signs of infections around the implant which is also a good sign. The probing depths given also suggest that this implant is stable, as they have not increase over the 12 months. Suggesting that the impant has not been rejected or caused irrtation to the gingival pockets, also shows cleaning has been adaquet.<br/><br/>B. In terms of a main treatment goal, my treatment goal for this 48 year old patient would be to retain this implant and keep it stable. Some preventative advice for this patient would be an introduction into interdental cleaning. Whilst using a electric toothbrush is good for some plaque control it does not account for the plaque inbetween the implant and other teeth as well as the gingiva. Keeping these areas clean of bacteria is essential to retaining the implant. I would suggest the use of Piksters or special oral B super floss, it would be imporant to give this OHE as a demonstration to the patient so he understands the maintence required at home.

Within the oral cavity when the flouride ion F- is intergrated as a solid and can be dissolved through plaque and enamel fluid it replaces the OH- (acid) ion in hydroxyapatite crystal to form fluorapatite. The Flourapatite crystal is stronger than the hydroxyapatite crystal and more resistant to an acid attack because it has a lower soulbility.

Please respond in the box below. How is this diagnosis defined and how is it different from odontogenic pain? (10 Marks) with answer: Temporomandibular disorder is defined by the pain orginating from the Temporal Mandibular Junction. Odontogenic pain is pain from the tooth such as dentine, pulpal, PDL. When diagnosing TMD, symptoms can be observed such as clinking and deviation of the TMJ, tenderness when palating that area, and it having a dull and diffused pain and difficulting on range of motion of the mouth vertically and laterally. TMD is pain arising from the articulating-disk and condyle. If a patient is unable to open their mouth veritally more than 35mm-40mm and laterally 3mm-4mm, they may have TMD. To diagnose TMD as an OHT, we should first rule out any odontogenic causes that may relate to the patient's pain. To do this, we need to perform clinical testing and investigations such as E/O and I/O examinations, palpate muscles of mastication, lymph nodes and salivary glands. Then investigate odontogenic possibilites for pain with tests such as palpation, percussion. If the pain is confirmed not to be odontogenic, then TMD can be inferred.\n",

(4 marks) with answer: A) This has occured due to incorrect positioning of administering the IAN block and inserting too far in which the needle and anasthetic has reach the parotid gland, resulting in facial paralysis. When facing this issue, it is important to let the patient know what happened and allow them to be aware of the situation. In this instance, we much explain how their facial paralysis has occured and inform them that this issue is not harmful to them. Explain to the pt that the paralysis is not permenant and explain to them the paralysis will stop in a few hours.

Let them know that is the symtoms persist past the few hours, to immediately return to the hospital.<br/><br/>B) If Cindy has buccal facial swelling, it may be a sign of inflammation. If the area around the 54 is swelling, the pH may have decreased. In this instance, the LA would be less effective as the pKA of the LA would be higher than the environemnt of her mouth. This leads to more ionisation of the LA therefore, it would have a slower onset and have less effectiveness and duration.\n",

      "Processing Question 26: There is one part to this question. Please respond in the box below.Which components of saliva contribute to its protective functions within the oral cavity? Briefly state how. (10 marks) with answer: Saliva has four main protectice functions in the oral cavity: Lubricating, Clensing, Anti-microbial and Buffering<br/><br/>As saliva has mucins, it allows it to have lubricating properties within the mouth, preventing xerostomia which can lead to the undersaturation of remineralisation ions such as calcium and phosphate. It can also lubricate food, making it easier to be swallowed, therefore, not being retained on the tooth surface.<br/><br/>Saliva clenses the mouth, allowing pathogenic bacteria to be swallowed and remaining food particles to be swallowed. Addtionally, clensing can allow the stephen's curve gradual uptake of the pH in the mouth to return to the critical pH of 5.5 after consuming food, that without bacteria would take longer and suscept the mouth to be below the critical pH for longer.<br/><br/>Saliva also has antimicrobial agents such as proline-rich proteins and lyzosomes that allow inhibit pathogenic bacteria precpitiation and allows the formation of a pellical to form. The pellical acts as a protective barrier for the tooth surface against harmful bacteria that causes demineralisation.<br/><br/>Finally, saliva has buffering properties as it contains bicarbonate and carbohexine IV, which buffers the acid within the mouth.<br/><br/>\n",

They want to know why they need to use a fluoride paste and you tell them the addition of fluoride can make the tooth mineral stronger.There are two parts to this question. Please respond in the box below and label each A and B.A. When thinking about fluorapatite formation, how does fluoride become incorporated into the hydroxyapatite crystal and why is fluorapatite stronger and more resistant to acid attack? 5 marksB. The progression of demineralisation of enamel can be influenced by which factors? 5 marks with answer: A) When fluoride is applied topically such as the \"fluoridated toothpaste\", it introduces the fluoride ions onto the tooth's surface. It allows supersatuation of fluoride, calcium and phospate ions, favouring remineralisation. Fluoride's antimicrobial agents also allows for less pathogenic bacteria, increasing phospate and calcium ions. The fluoride is then able to cross the membrane and create fluorapatite crystals, replacing the demineralised hydroxyapatite crystals. These crystals are more tightly compact than hydroxyapatite crystals, allowing them to be more stable. They are also less porous than hydroxyapatite, allowing them to be more resilient to acid attacks.<br/><br/>B) The progression of demineralisation of enamel can be influenced by factors such as salivary production, the pellical, pH of the mouth and microbial colonisation. As the mouth becomes more acidic, leading to a drop below the critical pH of 5.5, the environment of the mouth may harbour more acidgenic and acidoduric bacteria, resulting in demineralisation of the enamel. Furthermore, if there is not a pellical layer, there is no protection for the enamel against the bacteria, which makes the environment understaturated with the loss of calcium and phosphate ions. Addtionally without saliva, there is less buffering against lactic acid and clensing of the pathogenic bacteria on the enamel surface. Plaque accumulation may also progress the demineralisation of enamel as bacteria can continue to produce acid that demineralises the enamel where it is stagnated.\n",

This will impact the onset and effectiveness of the LA as the low pH of the site is shifted away from the pKa of the LA (the pH at which the concentration of the basic and acidic forms of the molecules are equal) . This means that there will be less unionised molecules of the LA to enter the axonal membrane and thus less ionised molecules to block the sodium channels of the membrane.

My presumptive diagnosis would be peri implantitis of the 15.<br/><br/>This diagnosis is supported by the below factors:<br/><br/>* The radiograph indicates that there is both horizontal and vertical bone loss occuring around the implant<br/><br/>* There is bleeding on probing on all surrounding sites, this indicates significant inflammation occuring around the gingival tissues of the implant.<br/><br/>* Patient reports brushing 2/day with the electric toothbrush without any flossing. Given the pocket depths at baseline, flossing would have been essential to prevent further progression of gingival disease and bone loss. However, since the patient has not incorporated it into their oral health routine, this would indicate a progression towards gingival disease.<br/><br/>B. Main treatment goal: maintain current integrity of implant<br/><br/>Preventative advice<br/><br/>Supporting rationale<br/><br/>1. Use an interdental brush<br/><br/>To remove food and plaque interproximally to prevent the inflammatory response in the gingiva which would cause further progression of gingival disease. Using an interdental brush will ensure that those hard to reach areas will be cleaned adequately whilst being less technique sensitive compared to other interdental cleaning products like a floss.<br/><br/>2. Attend their dental appointments, regularly<br/><br/>To supplement their at home care, it is important to seek professional support with implant care as the clinicians will be able to professional debride using specialist instruments and also give catered advice/feedback about the patient's technique, enhancing their oral health.<br/><br/>3.

Based solely on the information you have, what is your presumptive diagnosis and supporting rationale? (4 Marks)B. Outline your initial and intermediate management of this patient as an Oral Health Therapist (6 Marks) with answer: A. My presumptive diagnosis would be a pericoronal infection of the 48's gingiva (operculum).<br/><br/>This diagnosis is supported by the below factors:<br/><br/>* Unlike a peridontal or periapical infection where there is a presence of abscess around the periodontium or towards the periapical area, this swollen and red tissue is covering a partially erupted tooth and is indicative of a pericoronal infection.<br/><br/>* The operculum, which is the excess gingiva covering the partially erupted 48, is swollen and red which is a sign of infection due to the presence of an inflammatory response to potentially debris (food getting stuck underneath)<br/><br/>* Additionally, the patient could also be causing mechanical trauma on the gingival tissue each time they bite down leading to further pain of the tissue.<br/><br/>B. My management plan would be as follow:<br/><br/>1. Remove any debris found underneath the operculum with a tweezer<br/><br/>2. Rinse area with saline through a plastic syringe to cleanse area of any debris<br/><br/>3. Gently debride the tooth to aid in plaque control of the area<br/><br/>4. Request for an intraoral radiograph to check for any carious lesions, especially on the distal of the tooth<br/><br/>5. Review response of the tissue following the debridement and removal of debris.<br/><br/>6.

Briefly state how. (10 marks) with answer: Protective components of saliva<br/><br/>How<br/><br/>Buffering ability<br/><br/>The presence of enzymes which convert CO2 and H2O into bicarbonate, in serous saliva, enhances the production of bicarbonate which is a buffer essential in resisting change in the pH of the oral cavity. It allows the pH to return back to its neutral state efficiently, following a pH change due to the presence of bacteria either producing nitrate (basic) or lactic acid (acidic).<br/><br/>Supersaturated state<br/><br/>Saliva is rich in free stablised calcium and phosphate ions, which are essential in the process of remineralisation, preventing the loss of enamel minerals into the oral cavity by allowing the ions to form precipitate back on the enamel.<br/><br/>Lubricating<br/><br/>Proteins in saliva, such as mucin, agglutinates the food and bacterial molecules which enables easier swallowing and cleansing of the oral cavity, free from sugars and bacteria necessary to promote the carious process.<br/><br/>Antimicrobial<br/><br/>Saliva contains enzymes such as lysozyme which play a role in protecting the oral cavity from antimicrobial activity.<br/><br/>Protective pellicle<br/><br/>Saliva form a protective layer of pellicle which covers the surfaces of the teeth, preventing it from acid attacks from bacteria.\n",

Please respond in the box below and label each A and B.A. When thinking about fluorapatite formation, how does fluoride become incorporated into the hydroxyapatite crystal and why is fluorapatite stronger and more resistant to acid attack? 5 marksB. The progression of demineralisation of enamel can be influenced by which factors? 5 marks with answer: A. Compared to the OH- ion, F- is more and easily attracted to the free calcium and phosphate ions available. Thus, during remineralisation where solid crystal precipitate is formed back in the enamel, fluoride forms a bond with the free calcium and phosphate as fluorapatite. As fluoride is forms a crystal precipitate more easily, remineralisation is promoted and thus making the fluorapatite crystals stronger and more resistant to acid attack.<br/><br/>B. The progression of demineralisation is influenced by:<br/><br/>Presence of sugar: An increase in sugar availibility, either due to increased consumption or the lack of oral hygiene can provide the bacteria of the oral cavity with additional nutritional sources and which allows metabolism of the sugar, thus increasing the amount of lactic acid being produced. Due to the increase in lactic acid, the pH of the oral cavity will be low and dissolution of the enamel minerals will be promoted.<br/><br/>Presence of bacteria: Due to the lack of oral hygiene, if there is mature plaque biofilm building on the tooth surfaces, densely packed with pathogenic bacteria, there will be an increase in lactic acid production leading to demineralisation of the enamel, similar to the reasons above.<br/><br/>Lack of salivary protection: Saliva has a multitude of protective factors due to characteristics such as its buffering ability, and without it the enamel will not be protected from the acid attack of the pathogenic bacteria present in the oral cavity.<br/><br/>\n",

(6 Marks)B. Cindy is 5 and needs and extraction of the 54. She has buccal facial swelling.Would this Impact the onset and effectiveness of local anaesthesia at this site. why/why not? (4 marks) with answer: A. As the Inferior Alevolar Nerve (IAN) block is a large nerve, and due to anatomical location, unilateral facial paralysis is likely to have occurred due to systemic uptake and circulation of administrated local anaesthetic (LA). This means instead of LA only reaching target site with injection, it has been circulated and reached other nerves on the right-hand side, leading to paralysis.<br/><br/>It is important to monitor patient for any signs of systemic toxicity (nausea, slurring words, increased/rapid heart beat), to ensure they recieve required help if there are signs of this. It is also important to acknowledge and explain to the patient what is happening, how it can occasionally happen, and that you (as a clincian) will continue to monitor and be there to treat if anything occurs. It is important to try calm the patient down, reducing and minimising feelings of anxiety or panic.<br/><br/>B. Buccal facial swelling indicates an infection in that area, impacting the onset & effectiveness of LA at this site. Infection in tissue will lead to a decrease in tissue pH levels. When LA is administrated, only uncharged LA ions are able to penetrate and enter the nerve. If LA is administrated into tissue with a low pH level, there will be more ionised LA ions in the tissue (than normal) which then are unable to penetrate the nerve effectively. If LA is unable to penetrate nerve, action potentials are not inhibited effectively, and therefore the pain response is not inhibited.Inability to efficiently inhibit action potentials will result in a slower onset of LA, and may even result in failed LA at the site.\n",

I would give them instructions to not eat or drink anything too hot and to be aware not to bite or chew on the right side of their mouth for a couple of hours. I would also tell them to call the hospital if theyre still experienceing paralysis after around 3 hours.<br/><br/>B)<br/><br/>Buccal swelling could indicate an infection. LA is a weak base and therfore injecting it in a site of infection where the area is inflammed and acidic (having a lower PH) can impact the onset of the LA. The weak base means it will be quickly ionsised resulting in a quicker onset time due to more LA being absorbed through the cell membrane. This also makes it less effective as the LA will have a shorter duration of action as the inflammed sites have dialated capillaries diffusing and passing the LA thorugh the body quicker.\n",

(4 marks) with answer: A. The facial paralysis has occured because the LA has been distributed to the parotid gland and that is where the facial nerve runs thorugh, and facial nerve innervated the side of the face. The most likely cause of this is that the needle may have not touched bone and have gone staright thorugh and peirced the parotid gland. It may also be due to different structures and anatomy of the patient.<br/><br/>To manage the facial paralysis, we have to let it heal by itself as the LA runs off. We have to reassure the patient that is normal and not a very big problem, and tell them that it will wear off after a few hours, until then that side of the face is paralysed and no sensations.<br/><br/>B. Yes, as she would need a buccal infil to anaesthesise the area of the 54 and there is swelling= inflammation at the site, it impacts the onset and effectiveness of the LA. because:<br/><br/>* inflammation at the site= vasodilation, and LA naturally has vasodilators, but has vasoconstrictors to constrict the blood vessels for faster duration of the LA- and as there is dilation at the site, the LA inserted would not be effective because it will flow through it very quickly.<br/><br/>* also the LA wont be effective there because there are lots of other inflammatory cells, e.g. cytokines, at the site and LA will not be blocking the sodium channels for it to not produce pain response, as such the LA wont be effective at the site of the infection.\n",

Also the pt doesnt use any form of interdental cleaning or antimicrobials to help with plaque control, only toothbrushing which only helps with surface cleaning.<br/><br/>B. The main treatment goal would be to do effective plaque removal around the implant and be careful not to use sharp objects as it can scratch the titanium and make it more prone to plaque. Also reinforce OHI for the patient to make sure that they are cleaning the teeth properly to reduce inflammation and have effective plaque removal. I would make sure they also use interdental cleaning such as superfloss/ waterfloss to help clean interdentally, and could also use antimicrobial agents such as chlorohexadine for a short term use to help with plaque and bacterial control. This so that the area around the implant is kept clean and avoid bacterial invasion into the sulcus and stagnation that can lead to inflammation and if not taken under control would lead to bone loss, and may result to implantitis, and may need to extract or invasive cleaning around the implant. Also since the pt got the implant 12 months and has only come in to check in now and not earlier, we need to make sure the recalls are shorter like 6 months to make sure they are effectively maintaing good oral hygiene and implant hygiene, and also need to assess any changes that may have occured, (medical histories/ meds) which may need close attention as some can make the conditions worse for the implant health espeically immunosuppressed patients.\n",

As an oral health therapist I would first review their OHI and see that they are doing to take care and clean their teeth for plaque control. If it is not that great i would recommend them to use electrical tooth brush with fluoride toothpaste, with electric water flosser and OH 2x per day to effectively remove the plaque in the teeth. Then I would refer them to take an OPG to see if the tooth has been impacted or clinically see if there is enough space for the teeth to grow properly.<br/><br/>Intermediatelly i can debride the teeth for them just to make sure all calculus and plaque has been removed, and could apply topical fluoride to help the teeth be strong and less prone to demineralsiation.<br/><br/>If not, then I will refer them off to the dentist for the possible extraction of the teeth because if it impacted then it will cause it too demineralsie and more prone to caries as well the teeth next to it and cause further problems or push the other teeth creating overcrowd of the other teeth. eventually affecting other teeth, making them harder to clean, therefore increases the risk of carious lesions and increased caries.\n",

The progression of demineralisation of enamel can be influenced by which factors? 5 marks with answer: A. During demin the hydroxyapatite cystal dissolves and becomes into seperate ions, Ca2+, PO43-, OH- and are freely floating around in plaque which increases demineralisation, so when fluoride is applied topically, F- is joint with Ca2+, PO43- which are also flowing freely around, they bind and create fluoroapatite which is stronger cystal and less prone to acid attacks. fluoroapatite is stronger because it is much harder for the acids to break down the crystal due to the strong bonds that hold these together.<br/><br/>B.Patient factors- if they are not taking good oral care of their teeth and not effectively during oral hygiene, then plaque stays in the mouth, feeding on from the carbs and sugars in the mouth and eventually turning the environemtn in the mouth more acidic due to the production of lactic acid contributing to demineralisation.<br/><br/>diet- if they are frequently snacking on sticky and sweet, sugary snacks in between meals, they are more likely increased of caries progression because the bacteria is fed with the sugars and produces more lactic acid increasing demineralisation of the enamel, and the carious process.<br/><br/>* also if they are not seeing the dentist frequently and arent using fluoride toothpaste, then they may not know if something is going wrong in the mouth, and there constant demineralisation sways more towards cavitation, and no fluoride means no protection and less to no reminalisation of the enamel.<br/><br/>* low saliva production- As saliva has antimicrobial effects and helps protect the teeth with the pellicle layer, it fights back against demineralisation to contantly favour remin, however with dry mouth or inadeuate salivary flow rate, the teeth are more more prone to demineralisation as the protective and antimicrobial effects of saliva are not present.<br/><br/>\n",

(4 marks) with answer: A. This condition has occured due to adminsitering the local anaesthesia in the wrong location, which is into the parotid gland, within which the facial nerve runs through. the parotid gland lies posterior to the pterygomandibualr space, which is the target area for the IAN block, and hence this occured due to the clincian admisitering the needle too deep. thus by admisitering the local anaesthesia into this location, it has led to anaesthesia of the facial nerve, which is responsible for the muslces of facial expression, and thus the individual has lost the ability to move the muscles on the one side of the face. as the person has lost control of all her facial muscles on the one side, they are unable to control the muscles around their eyes, and thus measures sould be taken to protect the eye, such as placing an eye patch on. it is also imperitve that they are monitored and there is a follow up to ensure that the facial paralysis subsides.<br/><br/>B. yes this would impact the onset and effectivness of local anaesthesia (LA) at the site.<br/><br/>The effectnvess of LA is highly dependant on the pH of the surrounding tissues. LAs are weak bases with a pka of 8-9, and the closer the pH of the surrounding tisuse to the pka of the LA, the more of the drug will exist in its unionised form, and thus be able to cross the axonal membrane and reach the bidning site on the inner end of the na+ channel and thus preventing its oepning, hence leading to no AP firing and thus no pain is felt.<br/><br/>Howver, the patient has buccal facial swelling which is indicative of a spreading odontogenic infection through facisal spaces. hence, there will be infection around the site of injection and around the tooth, and thus the area will be acidic, have a low pH and contain lots of h+ ions.thus this would lead to more of the LA being converted to its ionised form, and thus less will be able to cross the axonal nerve membrane and reach the binding site on the inner end of the na+ channels and prevent their opening, and hence due to a decrease ability to do so, it will result in a decreased onset and effectnvess of the LA.\n",

(10 marks) with answer: 1. when did the patient have their last dose of prolia? prolia (denosumab) is a medication thay is given 6 monlthy for osteoporosis. it works by inhibiting RANKL and thus preveting the formation of osteoclasts. it is important to find out when their last dose was, as if the patient requires any surgical procedures such as an extraction and they had the prolia injection recently, it may increase the patients risk of developing medication related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ), as the reduced production of osteoclasts will prevent damaged bone from being removed from the site, which is the first step of the remodeling process and and thus impact the ability of the bone to heal. Thus, if the patient requires any surgical procedures, it may have to wait until the dose wears off towards the end of the 6 months so the MRONJ risk is reduced, however this would have to be managed in liasion with their prescribing doctor.<br/><br/>2. has the patient taken bisphosphonates before for their osteoporosis? even though the patient is on prolia, they may have taken bisphosphonates before to treat their osteoporisis. if the patient has taken a bisphosphonate in the last 4 years they are at high risk of MRONJ if they undergo a surgical procedure. this is because bisphosphonates decrease osteoclast activity and lead to osteoclast apoptosis. this will increase the patients risk of MRONJ, as following the procedure, he reduced production of osteoclasts will prevent damaged bone from being removed from the site, which is the first step of the remodeling process and and thus impact the ability of the bone to heal.<br/><br/>3. has the patient ever experienced gastrointestinal (GI) ulcers? the patient has refulx, which can contribute to the formation of a gastrointestinal ulcers. if the patient ever develops active GI ulcers, this is a contraindication for the prescription of a non sterioidal anti inflammatory drug (NSAID). and thus would impact the choice of analgesic advised if the patient ever requires in the future.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n",

In terms of preventative advice, i would adivse the patient that they need to be seen 6 monlthy at the dental clinic for a review, professional mechanical debridement, and reinforcmeent of oral hygiene routines, rather than 12 monlthy, as implants require more frequent care and close monitoring.<br/><br/>I would advise the patient to use an interdental brush as part of his at home oral hygiene routine. the patient is currently only using an electric toothbrrush 2x a day and not cleaning interdentally, which could cotribute to plaque and calculus deposits developing interproximally. i would measure the size of the interdental brush and show the patient how to use it in front of the mirror, ensuring that he understands how to use it.\n",

Outline your initial and intermediate management of this patient as an Oral Health Therapist (6 Marks) with answer: A. the presumptive diagnosis is peri coronitis. this is becuase peri coronitis is an acute periodontal infection that is assocated with a partially erupted tooth, as seen in the photograph.<br/><br/>B. the initial management of this patient would be to debride the area, which would remove any supra or subgingival plaque and calculus deposts that could be contributing to the infection. i would also adivse the patient to use chlorhexadine mouthwash, as the area would be painful to brush over, and having good plaque control in the area is imperitive. i would adivse the patient to brush the rest of their dentition normally. for the pain, i would advise the patient to take analgesics, ibuprofen 400mg and and paracetamol 1000mg 3 times daily (assuming if the patient has no contraindications to NSAID use) i would also review the patient within a week to see if the symptoms have alleviated and to determine if any further management would be required.<br/><br/>the intermediate management of the patient would be to refer the patient to a dentist or specialist for management of the peri-corontis. while debrideemnt, which is an OHTs scope, may settle the infection, there are other treatment options that need to be taken into consideration. the patient may require removal of the overgrown tissue, or extraction of the third molar, procedures which are out of the scope of an OHT, and hence require a dentist or specialist involvement.\n",

      "Processing Question 26: There is one part to this question. Please respond in the box below.Which components of saliva contribute to its protective functions within the oral cavity? Briefly state how. (10 marks) with answer: saliva has many protective effects inclusing lubruication of the oral mucosa, formation of the pellicle, promotion of remineralisation and protecting the teeth from acid attack and the assocaited demineralisation.<br/><br/>saliva contains bicarbonate and carbonic anhydrase (CA), which is the salivas main buffer system. when there is acid within the oral cavity, the bicarbonate reacts with thr h+ ions to form carboic acid, within which the CA then converts into water and carbon dioxide, thus reducing the amount of H+ ions in the oral cavity. this will help protect the teeth from demineralisaitom, as by reducing the amount of H+ ions, it will help keep the pH above the criticl pH of 5.5, and thus reduce the risk of deminerlisation, as the H+ ions will be buffered and not travel into the enamel fluid to promote a undersaturation with respect to HA.<br/><br/>saliva also has many antibacterial properties, which helps reduce the amount of bacteria and decrease their functioning in the oral cavity, and thus protects the teeth, as there will be less bacteria that are able to metabolise sugars into acid and hence will lead to a reduced risk of developing dental caries. there are many salivary proteins which have antibacteiral properties. Mucins and secratory immunoglobin A work by promoting agglutination of bacteria, which is the process of clumping the bacteria together and causing it to be swallowed and hence removed from the oral cavity.lactoferrin works by binding to ferric iron which reduces the amount of iron, which is an essential nutirent for bacteira, and without it will reduce the bacteriaas funcioning.lysozymes bind to bactera and cleave their cell wall, leading to cell death via lysis. moreover, salivary peroxidase neutralises hydrogen peroxide which is produced by bacteria, with a by product being hypothiocyanate, which works to reduce bacterial glycolysis and thus reduces their ability to metalbise sugars into acids, hence reuducing their cariogenic properties.<br/><br/>moreover, the saliva plays a key role in lubricating the oral cavity, thus preveting soft tissue damage. mucins plays a crucual role in this, as its large electronegativity attracts water and results in a superstructure that leads to enhaned lubrication.<br/><br/>moreover, salivary proteins, including mucins, statherian and proline rich proteins play a role in the pellicle formation. the pellicle is protective, as it provides a physical protection barrier over the tooth surface.<br/><br/>moreover, saliva has intrisic ca2+ and po43- ions which are stabilsied by statherian and proline rich proteins. these ions which are stabilised, are bioavaliable, and thus are avalaible to diffuse through the plaque fluid into the enamel fluid to promote a supersaturation with respect to HA, and thus remineralise the tooth if demineralisation has occured, thus protecting the tooth from caries progression.\n",

      "Processing Question 27: You are providing your patient with oral hygiene instructions and encourage the use of a fluoridated toothpaste twice daily. They want to know why they need to use a fluoride paste and you tell them the addition of fluoride can make the tooth mineral stronger.There are two parts to this question. Please respond in the box below and label each A and B.A. When thinking about fluorapatite formation, how does fluoride become incorporated into the hydroxyapatite crystal and why is fluorapatite stronger and more resistant to acid attack? 5 marksB. The progression of demineralisation of enamel can be influenced by which factors? 5 marks with answer: A.Flouride becomes incorperated into the hydroxyapatite crystal, as when demineralisation occurs, F- in the saliva (which can be from substances such as toothpaste), diffuses through the plaque fluid into the enamel fluid and readily reacts with ions to either recrystalise (if the other ions are in the tooth already) or remineralise (if the ca and po4 ions are also diffusing from outside the tooth as well). the F- replaces the OH- ions in hydroxyapatite. for flouride to travel into the enamel, it is aided by calcium. calcium bind with F- in the saliva and forms a net neutral form of Fluoride. this will aid the f- in getting deeper through the plaque fluid and reaching the tooth surface, as F- is now neutral and not negative and hence can travel easier through the plaque biofilm. Flouroapatite (FA) forms rapidly, as F- is highly electronegative and thus reacts readily with surrounding ions. FA is a more perfect crystal and is hence more resistant to acid attach. moreover, F- has the highest ca/po4 molar ratio and thus has the lowest solubulity, and thus is the most resistant to acid attack and disolution.<br/><br/><br/><br/>B.<br/><br/>* the amount of plaque - if there is more plaque, there is more bacteria avalaible to metabolise dietary sugars. the plaque that needs to form is closed plaque - which is the sticky plaque that forms in the presence of food.<br/><br/>* presence of dietary sugars - fermentable carbohydrates need to be provided to the bacteria in the oral cavity for acid to be formed and for it to contribute to a low pH below the critial pH of 5.5 and contribute to demineralisation.<br/><br/>* saliva flow and quality - saliva has many defence mecnaisms for neutralising the oral cavity and preveting demineraliastion of enamel. if saliva flow rate is low, the protective effects of saliva is reduced, and thus the enamel is at higher risk of demineralisation. for example if saliva flow rate is reduced, and a person eats soemthing surgary and the bacteria metabolises it to produce acid, there will be less bicarbonate avalaible to buffer acids,hence contribtuing to a sustained decrease of ph in the oral cavity below 5.5 due to the saliva not being able yo buffer the acids, thus increasing the risk of demineralisation.<br/><br/>* low pH of the oral cavity<br/><br/>* not using F- toothpaste - if a patient does not use F- toothpaste it can increase their risk of demineralisation, due to a decreased protective effect of F-. F- wont be avalaible to readily disolve into the enamel fluid and form FA when demineralisation occurs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n",

(6 Marks)B. Cindy is 5 and needs and extraction of the 54. She has buccal facial swelling.Would this Impact the onset and effectiveness of local anaesthesia at this site. why/why not? (4 marks) with answer: <br/><br/>A. The posterior border of the pterygomandibular space is the parotid gland, the parotid gland has the facial nerve passing which innervates muscles of the face, during LA of the IAN the needle is ideally injected into the pterygomandibular space to target the IAN nerve but if the needle is inserted and LA is injected too posteriorly it can anesthetise the parotid gland and as a result paralysis of the facial nerve and hence the droopy facial muscles on that side, this condition is called Bells palsy. The most important consideration for this is removing any lens if patient has any, and covering the eye with a eye patch because of paralysis of the facial nerve it will effect the muscles that control blinking and as a result patient cant blink which can cause the eye to dry out. Tell the patient it will wear off in a few hours 1-3 depending on the anesthetic used and if it doesnt then call the dental clinic or gp.<br/><br/>B. Buccal facial swelling indicates infection and inflammation in the facia of the buccinator muscle and formation of the fasical space. This would impact the onset and effectiveness of LA because<br/><br/>- The infection is in the buccal space which is close to the 54 and when LA is deposited because of the infection present being acidic in nature the pH will be low due to the infection the LA will be in more ionized form, only the non ionized molecules can pass through the membrane and reach the target tissue, so because of infection most LA will be ionized and not able to cross membrane and extert its effect this delay the onset of the LA because the molecules are not able to pass the mmebrane and bind to the receptors they need to. So the onset is delayed because more ionized molecules present and so they cant pass the cell membrane this will also effect effectiveness because if they cant pass the membrane they cant bind to the sodium channels and prevent action potential.\n",

Because he has no medical conditions and no medications that contradict NSAIDS, he can take it and have it with or without food but its recommended to take it with food to avoid distrurbing the stomach. Paracetamol is also recommended at the same time as the NSAID because it also provides analgesia pain releif by blocking cox 1 and 2 in the CNS only, and taken together with NSAID there is a synergistic effect so its more effective the pain releif. Also could have given the Paracetamol alone but because he is afraid of the pain and is getting deep scaling it may cause inflammation in the coming days hence the ibuprofen.<br/><br/>non selective NSAIDs like ibuprofen inhibit the action of cox 1 and 2 enzymes that convert archinadonic acid to prostaglandins that are responsible for inflammatory effects and nociception so pain.\n",

Please respond in the box below and label each A and B.A. When thinking about fluorapatite formation, how does fluoride become incorporated into the hydroxyapatite crystal and why is fluorapatite stronger and more resistant to acid attack? 5 marksB. The progression of demineralisation of enamel can be influenced by which factors? 5 marks with answer: A: Fluoride can only be incorporated into the hydroxyapaptie crystal after theres been a caries challenge, so basically in a caries challenge we have resting pH of saliva 6.5-7 which rapidly decreases because of the acids being produced by bacteria or acid being ingested, when the pH is decreasing on the tooth surface and the plaque fluid, enamel fluid it will reach 5.5 which is the critical pH of enamel and the hydroxyapatite crytals within after this pH the calcium and phosphate ions start to dissolve and dissasociate from the hydroxyapaptie crystal, this stage lasts for 20-30 mins then due to the natural cleansing of saliva over time the next hour the pH starts to rise and go back to neutral pH, before hitting 5.5 this is the time fluoride ions present on the enamel surface can bind to the calcium ions that are moving out the enamel, because fluoride is highly negative it cant by itself enter the plaque/biofilm layer its hydrophobic and so it can bind to the calcium, once it neutralises it can then go down the conc gradient because the enamel will have less ions and so it will go into the enamel and fluoride has higher affinity and attraction to the apaptite crystals because of its charge and so theres preferential formation of fluoroapatite instead of hydroxyapaptie. Fluoroapatite also bonds stronger to the apaptie crystal because of its charge which makes it more resistant to lower pH or acidic environments and has a lower critical pH so it dissolutes at a pH lower than that of hydroxyapaptie essesntially making the teeth stronger because they can now resist more lower pHs. So fluoride needs a caries challenge and needs to bind to calcium thats released in the demineralisation to neutraluise then enter the enamel.<br/><br/>B: so the progression of demineralisation of enamel can be influenced by<br/><br/>* How long exposure to acid is: if there is frequent exposure to acids and sugars and snacking the bacteria continously getting food and metabolising the sugars producing acids not allowing remineralisation to happen or not letting the pH rise, if the pH is constantly low that means the acids will continous dissolving the enamel and directly impacts the rate and progression of demineralisation<br/><br/>* Saliva quality and quantity: if there is less saliva flow then there will be delayed clearance of the acids on the surface of the tooth and hence it will increase the rate of progression of demienralisation in enamel,. along with that the type of saliva and time of day if its more serous or mucus during the night more mucus saliva is secreated whihc has more roles on moisturising the tissues whereas when eating or stimulated more serous saliva that has greater bicarbonate ions concentration and the bicarbonates can neutralise the acids and decrease the amount acids are in contact with the tooth.<br/><br/>* thickeness and nature of the biofilm: if the biofilm is thick and hydrophobic it will prevent saliva from entering and cleasing the area allowing a more cariogenic acidogenic enviuronment where the acids can thrive longer and cause more demineralisation of the enamel<br/><br/>* how long the acid remains inside the enamel: this can be in comparison to the amount of fluoride, calcium and phosphate present in saliva in bioavaliable forms, the more supersaturated the saliva so more ions in saliva compared to the enamel fluid there will be remineralisation, but if it remains understaruated for longer there will be increase in rate of demineralisation<br/><br/>* How fast the hydrogen ions enter enamel: this depends on the concentration gradient and also the fluid present within the enamel.\n",

(6 Marks)B. Cindy is 5 and needs and extraction of the 54. She has buccal facial swelling.Would this Impact the onset and effectiveness of local anaesthesia at this site. why/why not? (4 marks) with answer: A. The reason the unilateral faciual paralysis on the same saide as the Right-Hand Side Inferior Alveolar Nerve block injection has occured is because the injection has not hit the target area and instead has injected into the bloodstream. Many reason can cause this incident to occure these include the following:<br/><br/>Not identifying the correct landmarks of the targeted area, it is always important to detect the landmarks by palpating and visually observing the area before picking up the syringe and administer the solution.<br/><br/>Another reason include when inserting the needle, the needle has possibly hit the bone too early meaning the insersion is in the incorrect site and it is too anterior. it is important to ensure to use a long needle and ensure that about 25mm of the needle is inserted into before hitting the bone.<br/><br/>Another factor that can contribute to this issue is not aspirating, aspiration allows fluide to from the tip of the needle to be drawn back into the cartridge. Ensuring to aspirate on two planes after inserting the needle allwos us to check if the needle has been injected into the bloodstream as blood will be drawn back into the cartridge.<br/><br/>To manage this issue, it is important to observe the patient and ask questions regarding their sensation and its severity. Then is very cruical to explain to the patient why this has happened and ensure they understand the explanation. After, appropiate instructions will be given, informing the patient that they will experience loss of sesnsation in their right hand side of the face for a few hours and it will start wearing off gradually. Lastly, it is very important to emphasise to that if the sensation does not come back for the whole day, the patient needs to call the clinic and inform then and seek immediate medical attetion.<br/><br/><br/><br/>B. The buccal facial swelling will impact the onset of local anaesthesia (LA) the reason is because the tissues at the site of the injection will make the pH level more acidic due to the possible infection. Since the LA has a weak base and needs to be non-ionised to be absorbed into the the tissue membrane, the la becomes more ionised so less is absorbed through the cell membrane. It is also affected as the cell membrane permeability and sensitivity is compromised and the LA solution's dissusion into the sodium channels will be impacted.\n",

The presumptive diagnosis for this case is localised plaque induced gingivitis. the reason is due to the clinical findings. the patient has probing depths of 4mm on all aspects of the tooth in the baseline appointment after the initial placement and has remained the same after the 12 month review, which, since it is above the healthy range of 1-3mm pocket depths. it is likely to be ocalised plaque induced gingivits. It is also due to the bleeding on probing noted on all sites, indicating the presence of calculus around the surfaces. The bleeding can also be explained by the abcense of interdental aids used as part of the oral hygiene routine by the patient. the radiographs provided indicate no radiographic bone loss from the time of placement and the 12 monthly review, thus helping in rulling out peri-implantitis as the presumptive diagnosis.<br/><br/>B. The treatment goal is to start debridement. using hand scalers and gently debride all surfaces of the teeth, if present, it would be favourable to use impalnt-designed ultrasonic scalers and review in a 6 monthly recall to review tissue response to debridement. this treatment approach is suitable for the patient because the patient does not have an optimal hygiene routine and bleeding indicates plaque and/or calculus presence and if left untreated, the disease can progress. Preventive advice will include explaining to the patient to use floss as part of their oral hygiene routine, once a day in the night, before brushing and using the C-shape technique where the floss 'hugs the tooth' and is inserted a little bit under the gum line to ensure subgingival bacteria is removed. It is also important to explaine to the patient that they continue brushing twice a day for two minutes each using fluoridated toothpaste. if patient does not find using floss confortable they can consider interdental brushs, I will help the patient finsing the right sizes and give the same instructions for use as the floss.\n",

Please view the clinical photograph below.There are two parts to this question. Please respond in the box below and label each A and BA. Based solely on the information you have, what is your presumptive diagnosis and supporting rationale? (4 Marks)B. Outline your initial and intermediate management of this patient as an Oral Health Therapist (6 Marks) with answer: A. presumptive diagnosis is likely to pericoronal inflammation, this is when there is an inflammation on the coronal part of the tooth and is usually likely affecting partially erupted teeth and mostly commonly the lower third molars. This inflammation can sometimes cause abcess foramtion. As seen in the image, the third molar of quadrant 4 is partially erupted and the overlaying gingiva is covering the didtal aspect of the tooth and is shown to be inflammed and swelled.<br/><br/>B. To manage this patient's condition, further investigations can. be done, including radiographs to assess the health of the tooth and if there is periapical defects such as periapical abcess. Possible treatments options may include gum recontouring allwoiung the inflammation to be reduced. To reduce the inflammtion and swelling, I would recommend to the patient NASIDs medications since no infections is reported however,I would take a detailed medical history and ask if she has any allergies to ensure i recommend the suitable medication and the right dosage, I would also explain to the patient that the medications would only relief the sympotoms and not address the cause of the condition. Lastly, potentially the tooth would need to be extracted, as an Oral Health Therapist, it is outside of our scope of practice to perform extractions of the permanent teeth therefore, I would refer the patient to a dentist.\n",

Please respond in the box below and label each A and B.A. When thinking about fluorapatite formation, how does fluoride become incorporated into the hydroxyapatite crystal and why is fluorapatite stronger and more resistant to acid attack? 5 marksB. The progression of demineralisation of enamel can be influenced by which factors? 5 marks with answer: A. when present in the mouth, fluoride is absorbed by the tooth surface and forms calcuim and phosphates, which are essential in helping restore minerals into the enamel and dentine. These get gets incorporated into the hydroxyapatite crystal which helps form fluroapetite, which, due to its mechanisms, is stronger in figthing acid attacks as it provides the layer of fluoride pellicle that protects against acidic bacteria from biding to the tooth surface.<br/><br/>B. The progression of demineralisation of enamel can be influenced by many factors, including the pH level, when the mouth is constantly in an acidic state, the bacteria feeds off the sugar charbohydrates and thus increases risks of caries. another factor is saliva quality and quantity, low salivary flow, means less buffering of the bacteria. also, diet can be an influencing factor as diets containing acidic and sugary drinks and meals with high carbohydrates in it can be a risk as it is a fuel for the bacteria.\n",

(10 Marks) with answer: HOW IS THE DIAGNOSIS DEFINED?<br/><br/>Through a thorough examination and assessment of the 42-year-old patient's TMJ, a diagnosis can be defined that she has a temporomandibular disorder. The examinations and investigations included to define the diagnosis may include:<br/><br/>1. Medical history - any medications the pt is taking, genetic history of TMD that runs in the family, or any other underlying medical conditions that she has which may predipose her towards experiencing symptoms of a TMD<br/><br/>2. Social history - any habits that she has associated with her jaw movement and function<br/><br/>3. Dental history - any relevant past dental history<br/><br/>4.

(6 Marks)B. Cindy is 5 and needs and extraction of the 54. She has buccal facial swelling.Would this Impact the onset and effectiveness of local anaesthesia at this site. why/why not? (4 marks) with answer: A.<br/><br/>* This has occurred because the clinician may have administered the LA in the wrong landmark of the buccal nerve when performing the RHS inferior alveolar nerve block, where the LA also travels and affects the other oral facial muscles on the same side. As a result of this, unilateral facial paralysis will occur and areas of the face will be paralysed including the eye lid, the cheek, lips and chin of the same side where the RHS IAN block has been administered.<br/><br/>The most important considerations in managing this includes:<br/><br/>1. Providing proper post-operative instructions - providing post operative care is essential to ensure that the patient is safe and okay before and after the dental procedure, especially with unilateral facial paralysis<br/><br/>2. Communicating with the patient - explaining to the patient that unilateral facial paralysis has occured, which is the reason as to why the patient may feel that facial features and aspects on the RHS is numb. you would also need to explain to the patient about how it has occurred such as discussing that the LA has been administered in the wrong aspect on the back of the mouth.<br/><br/>B. Yes, this will impact the onset and effectiveness of local anaesthesia at this site. If Cindy is presented with buccal facial swelling, this could alter the soft tissue and hard tissue landmarks and change the orientation of administering LA. Further, this could influence the ion channels, pKA and pH of the surrounding environment.

The medications I would recommend Mr AB for pain relief would be ibuforen 400mg in combination with paracetamol 1000mg 3 times a day, at the same time between 4-to-6 hours. Because Mr AB is an adult and is 35-years-old, ibuforen 400mg and paracetamol 1000mg 3 times a day, at the same time is the recommended dose and frequency of the pain relief medications as stated in the therapeutic guidelines.<br/><br/>B. I chose to recommend ibuforen 400mg and paracetamol 1000mg 3 times a day, at the same time for pain relief because it has been stated by the therapeutic guidelines that ibuforen and paracetamol are the first choice of pain relief to recommend. Ibuprofen is an anti-inflammatory and is known to have a higher efficacy and effective effect on pain compared to other pain relief medications.

When was Ms KB diagnosed with osteoporosis?<br/><br/>* Asking Ms KB when she was diagnosed with osteoporosis is important to know whether she was recently diagnosed with osteoporosis or whether she has had osteoporosis for a long time. This could determine if osteoporosis is a systemic factor to other dental conditions, or whether she has an increased risk for experiencing a oral condition.<br/><br/>2. When did Ms KB have a reflux ?<br/><br/>* Similar to asking when Ms KB was diagnosed with osteoporosis, it is also important to ask when she had been experiencing reflux.<br/><br/>3. What is the dosage and frequency of her Prolia and Somac medications?<br/><br/>* Asking about the dosage and frequency that she takes her Prolia and Somac medications is essential in medical history taking. We must ensure that we are aware of the drug, dosage and frequency of her medications to ensure for future prescriptions of other medications and whether it may have an adverse drug interactions with her current use of Prolia and Somac.<br/><br/>4. Are there any concerns or symptoms associated with reflux?<br/><br/>* Patients with a reflux means that their oral cavity and environment may be more prone to be exposed in acidic environments, contributing to dental concerns such as erosion and increased risk of development of caries. By asking Ms KB on any adverse effects she has experienced from her reflux, this provides a better understanding and helps in adjunction to an intra-oral soft and hard tissue examination.<br/><br/>5. How long the patient has been taking prolia and somac for, and has there been any adverse drug effects that you experiences?<br/><br/>* Asking the patient how long they have been prolia and somac for provides us a better understanding of the pt's current medical history and how effective her medications have been in relation to alleviating her osteoporosis and reflux.

There are two parts to this question. Please respond in the box below and label each A and BA, Based solely on the information you have, what is your presumptive diagnosis and supporting rationale? (4 Marks)B. Outline the main treatment goal and preventative advice, providing supporting rationale. (6 Marks) with answer: A. My presumative diagnosis in adjunctions to the findings found from the assessment of the pt's recall for his implant crown placement is that the pt is experiencing peri-implant mucositis. Peri-implant mucositis is a reversible inflammatory condition where the gingival tissues become inflammed and swollen confined to where the respective dental implant is located. Further, it is caused by the presence of plaque accumulation. It was stated that the pt has been using an electrical toothbrush x2 a day only for plaque control, which implies that the pt may be currently managing towards controlling plaque accumulation present. Further, the periodontal status and recordings was reported with probing depths of 4 with bleeding, suggestign that there is inflammation and an odemic appearance of the gingival tissues and health. With reference to the radiographs taken with the baseline (initial placement) and current appointment after 12 months of the implant crown placement, we can see that there is no relevant bone loss present in comparison to the two time periods.<br/><br/>B. The main treatment goal and prevenative advice includes:<br/><br/>1. providing OHI - educating the pt on proper toothbrushing technique, possibly asking the patient to demonstrate how they brush their teeth and then demonstrating and guiding the patient on ways to improve their toothbrushing technique. the clinician can also educate on flossing or interdental brushes, whether the patient has currently been interdental cleaning or flossing. asking the patient to demonstrate how they floss and then showing them ways to improve their flossing or interdental brushing technique may be effective in not only plaque control, but managing the health of the gingival tissues.<br/><br/>2. talking about management of dental implants - discussing the importance of managing dental implants can be overall effective with communicating with the patient of the risks that may occur if a dental implant is not effectively managed overtime, especially with plaque accumulation, bleeding on probing<br/><br/>3. debridement and clean - cleaning around areas of the dental implant without any metal instruments. use a non-metal instrument in consideration of the patient's safety and general health. cleaning around the implant will help support the healing of the gingival tissues, as well as remove loose plaque and debris present on the tooth surfaces located around the dental crown implant.\n",

Based solely on the information you have, what is your presumptive diagnosis and supporting rationale? (4 Marks)B. Outline your initial and intermediate management of this patient as an Oral Health Therapist (6 Marks) with answer: A. This is a peri-coronal abscess and is caused due to the presence of a partially erupted third molar on the distal aspect. Through clinical examination, it can be seen that there is an abscess present with suppuration, bleeding and inflammation on the distal aspect of the partially erupted third molar. An abscess is a collection of pus filled with bacteria and dead neutrophils and is caused by the host's immediate response to the presence of bacteria. Further, a peri-coronal abscess can be caused in response to the partial eruption of the third molar, contributing to the inflammation and swelling of the gingival tissues surrounding the third back molar. Further, the pt has also reported pain localised in the respective area of the partially erupted third molar, indicating that it is an abscess located peri-coronally.<br/><br/>B. The initial and immediate management of this patient as an OHT includes:<br/><br/>* provision of OHI - providing the recommended oral hygiene instructions such as proper toothbrushing technique, oral health education, flossing and suggesting ways on how to effectively clean the back molars.<br/><br/>* consulting with a dentist about whether to prescribe antibiotics, metromidazine 400mg, for the pt's pain if the patient cannot receive treatment within 24 hours.<br/><br/>* referring the patient to get the peri-coronal abscess to get drained.\n",

Please respond in the box below and label each A and B.A. When thinking about fluorapatite formation, how does fluoride become incorporated into the hydroxyapatite crystal and why is fluorapatite stronger and more resistant to acid attack? 5 marksB. The progression of demineralisation of enamel can be influenced by which factors? 5 marks with answer: A. With fluoride, it works to inhibit the progress of demineralisation of the enamel and tooth surface. Fluoride in the form of F- travels and diffuses into the enamel surface. Because F- is strongly reactive, it allows the environment in the enamel to be supersaturated, which therefore allows for the formation and recrystalisation of hydroxyapatite with the lost ions, as well as the formation of fluroapatite (FA). Fluroapatite allows for a stronger effect and resistance against the acid attack from the bacteria found in dental plaque, which therefore promotes the remineralisation of the enamel and inhibits demineralisation. There is then no overall net loss of minerals. The ca2, po and oh ions are used and interacted with F- to form hydroxyapatite, and to also form fluroapatite. Fluoride can be incorporated in fluoridated toothpastes, mouthwashes or tooth mousse. Further, it is naturally present in our saliva, where our saliva acts as a protective coating on the enamel surfaces and promotes remineralisation of the teeth. Essentially, the addition of fluouride helps to use the lost ions that diffuses out of the enamel to form fluroapatite, which helps promote the remineralisation of demineralised enamel.<br/><br/>B. The progression of demineralisation of enamel can be influenced by:<br/><br/>1. Poor oral hygiene - poor toothbrushing technique, lack of toothbrushing<br/><br/>2. Diet e.g., high intake of sugary or acidic foods, lack of water consumption<br/><br/>3. Age - as an individual ages, their tooth structure may become more weaker and be unable to have the optimal salivary function and structual integrity of enamel to prevent the demineralisation progression<br/><br/>4.

(6 Marks)B. Cindy is 5 and needs and extraction of the 54. She has buccal facial swelling.Would this Impact the onset and effectiveness of local anaesthesia at this site. why/why not? (4 marks) with answer: A.<br/><br/>The patient is experiencing unilateral facial paralysis because it is likely that the clinican has inserted the needle beyond 25mm. When inserting the needle 25mm, the clinican should be able to reach resistance which is where the bone is. This indicates that is it the correct depth of insertion for IAN block. In this case, it is likely the clinican has inserted beyond 25mm and the local anaesthetic has been deposited in the partoid gland. The facial nerve runs through the paratoid gland and it is responsible for the facial sensations. As a result, the local anaesthetic has perfused through the parotid gland to the facial nerve and affecting the nerve to cause unilateral facial paralysis.<br/><br/>To manage this it is important to be transparent and explain to the patient what has happened and reassure the patient that as the local anaesthetic wears off the numbness should subside and completely resolve. Recommend to the patient that they may need to wear a eye patch to prevent the eye from become dry as they may find it difficult to close their affected eye. If the numbness does not wear off and facial paralysis is not resolved after 2 hours, recommend the patient to call the clinic immediately for further advice.<br/><br/><br/><br/>B.<br/><br/>Yes, this will impact the onset and effectiveness of the local anaesthetic at this site.<br/><br/>The local anaesthetic must be in its non-ionised form to be able cross the cell membrane and have an effective response. Local anaesthetic is influenced by the environmental pH. At low pH (or in acidic environments), the local anaesthetic is converted into their ionised form, which makes it difficult to cross the membrane to have its effect.<br/><br/>When you have a buccal facial swelling, it is due to an infection. Infections in the area can lead to an decrease in the pH, forming an acidic environment. Therefore, when local anaesthetic is injected into the area, there is more ionised form of the local anaesthetic. This reduces its effectiveness and can delay the onset of the local anaesthetic.\n",

Briefly state how. (10 marks) with answer: Protective functions of saliva<br/><br/>* Supersaturated with calcium and phosphate ion<br/><br/>* The saliva provides a supersaturated environment filled with calcium and phosphate ions. This help prevent demineralisation or dissociation of the apatite crystals. It also supports the remineralisation of minor defects by precipitation of the calcium phosphate crystals, especially at the surface of the tooth.<br/><br/>* Proteins such as proline rich protein prevents the preciptation of these ions in the oral cavity, to ensure it bioavaliable for remineralisation.<br/><br/>* Formation of the pellicle layer<br/><br/>* The pellicle layer is a thin acellular organic layer formed by components in the saliva (mainly proteins such as proline rich proteins). This forms a protective layer on the tooth surface and makes it reistance to bacterial acid. It also restricts the movement of mineral ions within the pellicle and help precipitation of minerals at the surface.<br/><br/>* Buffering capacity<br/><br/>* Bacteria in the oral cavity can ferment the carbohydrate and produce acid, such as lactic acid, lowering the pH and eventually can lead to dissociation of the apatite crystals. Therefore the bicarbonate produced by saliva helps neutralise the pH in the oral cavity and tries to prevent it from reaching the critical pH.<br/><br/>* Antimicrobial effect<br/><br/>* Salivary peroxidase removes hydrogen peroxide produce by bacteria and converts it into hypothiocynate which can prevent bacterial glycolysis and cause bacterial death.<br/><br/>* Lactoferrin in saliva can prevent bacterial metabolism by binding to the iron which is an essential element for bacterial metabolism. This interferes with bacterial function and reproduction. Thus, bacteriocidal.<br/><br/>* Mucin: Mucin 1 helps with remineralisation and formation of pellicle but mucin 2 helps with agglutination of bacteria and removal from the oral cavity through swallowing.<br/><br/>* IgA and glycoprotein can also cause agglutination of bacteria and removal from the oral cavity through swallowing.<br/><br/>* Coating<br/><br/>* It provides a coating around the teeth to prevent mechanical wear and chemical erosion.<br/><br/>\n",

The progression of demineralisation of enamel can be influenced by which factors? 5 marks with answer: A. Fluoride replaces the OH- ion in the hydroxyapatite crystal to form fluorapatite crystals. Fluroide is able to react fast and form fluroapatite crystals, which has a tighter crystal structure compared to hydroxyapatite. Therefore it has a lower critical pH and making it resistant dissolution of the crystal.<br/><br/>B.<br/><br/>Demineralisation of enamel can be influenced by:<br/><br/>* How quickly the bacteria forms acid through their fermentation process to reach the critical pH.<br/><br/>* The amount of unionised form of acid is present. Unionised form of the acid is able to diffuse across the pellicle more easily and can reach the enamel fluid faster.<br/><br/>* How quickly the non-ionised form of acid diffuses through the pellicle and the enamel fluid.<br/><br/>* How quickly the dissociation of the apatite crystals occur<br/><br/>* How quickly the calcium and phosphate ions diffuse out of the tooth and into the oral cavity.\n",

These free hydrogen ions then interact with free calcium and phospate ions which upsets the concentration gradient and calcium and phospate ions start to diffuse out of the enamel to try and equal out the concentration again.<br/><br/>Whether saliva flow is stimulated or not - Unstimulated saliva flow leads to increased demineralisation as there is not as much saliva to help with it's anti-caries properties.<br/><br/>Lack of free calcium + phospate ions in the mouth - apatite crystals start to demineralise to try and equal out the concentration.<br/><br/>The amount of fluoride present in the mouth - Fluoride can inhibit bacterial enzymes.<br/><br/>Consuming food or drinks with high acidity or sticky sugars - Will lead to a higher amount of acidity in the mouth and therefore demineralisation.<br/><br/>Chelation - molecules that want to bind to metals increase demineralisation as it means there is less free calcium ions in the mouth (calcium is a metal). 10 calcium ions are needed to form a hydroxyapatite crystal so a large amount of free calcium ions is very important.\n",

(10 Marks) with answer: Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is a condition of the temporomandibular joint in which there is parafunction in one or more of the following: the temporomandibular joint itself, the muscles or the positioning of the joint. The disorder can include but is not limited to symptoms like jaw, muscle pain or tenderness and can be (but is not always) associated with daytime or nighttime bruxism or clenching.<br/><br/>TMD is different to odontogenic pain in both the cause and the symptoms. TMD originates in the temporomandibular joint itself and may or may not be associated with tooth related symptoms.Odontogenic pain originates from the teeth or periodontium. The symptoms of odontogenic pain is usually unilateral and confined to the problemed tooth or soft tissue where the pain originates, whereas temporomandibular disorder can produce pain that is bilateral, from the left or right temporomandibular joint. Jaw or muscle pain and tenderness from temporomandibular disorders are commonly more severe in the morning (associated with night time clenching or bruxism) whereas the time of day itself usually does not affect the severity of odontogenic pain.\n",

(6 Marks)B. Cindy is 5 and needs and extraction of the 54. She has buccal facial swelling.Would this Impact the onset and effectiveness of local anaesthesia at this site. why/why not? (4 marks) with answer: A. This is Bells Pallsy and has occured due to the incorrect angulation of the needle when completing the Inferior Alveolar Nerve block. The anaesthesia was deposited more posterior than it should be, causing the anaesthetic solution to anaesthetise the facial nerve instead of the inferior alveolar nerve. As the facial nerve controls the muscles of facial expression, this causes facial paralysis on the same side as injection. The most important consideration in managing this is to explain to the patient what has occured, why it has occured and reassure them that this is temporary and the paralysis will wear off as the anaesthetic wears off in a few hours (around 4 hours). Explain to the patient that if they are still experiencing facial paralysis tomorrow, to contact their GP.<br/><br/>B. Buccal facial swelling will impact the onset and effectiveness of local anaesthesia as buccal facial swelling indicates that the infection has spread to the soft tissues nearby. This means that there are more bacteria and inflammatory mediators at the site of infection which may cause the tissues in the area to be more acidic due to bacterial byproducts and tissue breakdown producing lactic acid. As local anaesthetic is a weak base, in acidic environments, the anaesthetic will be more ionised. This will impact how much anaesthetic will be absorbed through the cell membrane as anaesthetic is only absorbed in non-ionised form. The amount of anaesthetic absorbed will affect the onset and effectiveness of the local anaesthetic, less being absorbed will result in slower onset and reduced effectiveness.\n",

(10 marks) with answer: Questions about osteoporosis:<br/><br/>Have they previously used bisphosphonates for osteoporosis? As bisphosphonates have a long half life (around 10 years), if Ms KB has previously used bisphosphonates, even though they no longer use it, there may still be traces of it in the body, leading to higher MRONJ risk.<br/><br/>If they have used bisphosphonates before, how long did they use bisphosphonates for? If Ms KB has used bisphosphonates for over 4 years, it leads to a higher risk of MRONJ.<br/><br/>When was their last Prolia injection? If Ms KB requires any procedures that may expose bone (eg. extractions), it should be done 4 weeks before their next Prolia injection to reduce the risk of MRONJ.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Questions about reflux:<br/><br/>How long have they had reflux for?<br/><br/>How long have they taken Somac for?<br/><br/>These two questions in combination with a clinical examination will help determine whether they are still at risk of further tooth damage from dental erosion. If they have had reflux for many years but have only recently started taking Somac, there could be substantial damage already done by erosion to their teeth.<br/><br/>Is there anything that triggers their reflux?<br/><br/>Avoiding any foods or drinks that trigger their reflux would be beneficial for their oral health. Heavy erosion on teeth may lead to Ms KB having to extract her teeth as erosion is harder to remineralise than caries and can be tricky to manage without extractions. If Ms KB previously took bisphosphonates for 4+ years and requires extractions, she is at a high risk of MRONJ. Thus, eliminating any potential risks that may trigger her influx would be beneficial to prevent any extractions being required.<br/><br/>\n",

(4 Marks)B. Outline the main treatment goal and preventative advice, providing supporting rationale. (6 Marks) with answer: A. My presumptive diagnosis would be peri-implant mucogingivitis:<br/><br/>The probing depths around the implant is 4mm, with bleeding on probing on all sites. Healthy probing depths around implants should be around 3mm with no bleeding on probing. Hence, there may be implant associated gingivitis.<br/><br/>Based on the baseline and current PA of the implant, it does not appear to have bone loss hence the diagnosis would not be peri-implantitis.<br/><br/>B. The main treatment goal would be to promote good oral hygiene, have healthy tissues around the implant and prevent the peri-implant mucogingivitis turning into peri-implantitis as preventing the disease from further impacting the soft tissues and potentially the bone surrounding the implant. Explaining this to the patient is crucial as it is much harder to treat peri-implantitis when it has resulted in bone loss.<br/><br/>Oral hygiene instructions is important as the patient currently only uses a tooth brush to brush the area twice a day. Whilst this is a good start, they should also be cleaning in the interproximal areas using interdental brushes to prevent plaque accumulation in the interproximal areas.

Briefly state how. (10 marks) with answer: Different components of saliva contribute to its protective functions within the oral cavity against microbes, acid attacks and soft tissue friction.<br/><br/>To protect against acid attacks:<br/><br/>* Components in the saliva contribute to pellicle formation. The pellicle is a physiological acellular protein layer that sits on top of teeth as a layer of protection against acid attacks to the teeth, preventing demineralisation. Some components that contribute to pellicle formation include statherins, proline rich proteins, lysozymes, histatins, cystatins, etc.<br/><br/>* Bicarbonate in the saliva act as a buffer against acids to resist the change in pH during an acid attack.<br/><br/>* Components in the saliva contribute to keeping calcium and phosphate in solution. There are calcium and phosphate ions in the saliva. Components like statherines and proline rich proteins help to keep these ions from forming calculus in the saliva. These ions can be used to increase the pH and remineralise teeth during an acid attack.<br/><br/>* As most of saliva is made of water, it helps to raise the pH.<br/><br/>Antimicrobial components in saliva:<br/><br/>* Some components contribute to direct killing of microbes with functions such as but not limited to cleaving cell walls, inhibiting colonisation of bacteria, causing bacterial lysis: lactoferrins, lysozymes, histatins, peroxidase, defensins<br/><br/>* Some components contribute to indirect killing of microbes with functions such as but not limited to inhibiting infection, bacteria metabolism, and bacteria or viral proteinase: lactoferrins (binds to ferric iron so bacteria cannot have access to crucial bacterial nutrients), lysozymes, histatins, cystatins, peroxidase, IgA.<br/><br/>* Some components assist with aggregation of bacteria, clumping them together so they can be swallowed: mucins Muc7, IgA, water in saliva as around 1-2ml of saliva will induce swallowing.<br/><br/>Lubrication by mucins in saliva helps to prevent friction against the soft tissues.\n",

Please respond in the box below and label each A and B.A. When thinking about fluorapatite formation, how does fluoride become incorporated into the hydroxyapatite crystal and why is fluorapatite stronger and more resistant to acid attack? 5 marksB. The progression of demineralisation of enamel can be influenced by which factors? 5 marks with answer: A.<br/><br/>Fluoride becomes incorporated into hydroxyapatite crystal when fluroide ions replaces the OH- ions in the hydroxyapatite crystal. This can occur when hydroxyapatite crystals become demineralised in an acid attack and free fluoride ions are present. The fluoride ions bind to the crystal in place of the OH- ions forming fluorapatite. Fluorapatite is stronger as the fluoride molecules are held closer to the crystal than the OH ions, being more resistant to acid by being harder to demineralise and hence \"stronger\" than hydroxyapatite.<br/><br/>B. The progression of demineralisation of enamel can be influenced by factors such as:<br/><br/>* the rate of acid diffusing onto the enamel surface<br/><br/>* rate of inward diffusion of acid in tooth,<br/><br/>* rate of outward diffusion of calcium, phosphate, hydroxide or fluoride ions from inside the tooth<br/><br/>* the amount of bicarbonate present in the saliva to buffer against the acid<br/><br/>* the amount of calcium, phosphate, hydroxide and fluoride ions present in the saliva<br/><br/>* How long the enamel is exposed to the acid<br/><br/>\n",

(10 Marks) with answer: Temperomandibular disorder (TMD) is a disorder that is different to odontogenic pain as it does not originate from teeth. Odontogenic pain stems from the teeth and is pain that is directly linked to that. TMD is directly related to the temperomandibular joint and the muscles of mastication. There are many factors that can contribute to TMD, the most significant factor is bruxism, clenching and grinding of the mouth. The clenching and grinding strains the muscles when it is supposed to be at rest. This can occur during the day and night, it is more focused on the use of the muscles when it is not supposed to be used (for example, we use the muscles of mastication and the temperomandibular joint when we are eating to open, close and left and right to grind our food. After eating this action stops and the mouth is supposed to be at a state of rest. However when there is constant clenshing or grinding throughout the day it strains the muscle and the joint.\n",

(4 marks) with answer: A)<br/><br/>* Unilateral facial paralysis after an injection is often temporary paralysis. This is due to poor administration of the LA. This occurs when the needle has slightly penetrated the membrane of the nerve and the aneasthetic solution has been injected into the nerve. The end of the needle has a pointed tip similar to a triangle( right angle), the end of the needle is supposed to be parallel to the nerve as to ensure that there is no penetration into the nerve, however in case this action was done. One reason this may have occured is the incorrect angulation when adminstration. IAN block administration is orientated 10mm above the occlusal plane above the premolars and inserted contralateraly the side we wish to aneasthetise. <br/><br/>* to manage this we would explain to patient what has happened and make sure they understand that it is common and that it will go away with time.

Taking buccal facial swelling into consideration, The anatomical landmarks that clinicans use to pinpoint where to insert the needed to aneasthetise may shift significantly depending on the severity of the swelling. There LA administered may not reach targeted nerve,<br/><br/>* welling is aften directly linked to inflammation. When inflammation is present the pH levels drop and the environement becomes more acidic. The low pH means that the la solution becomes more ionised so less is absorbed through the cell membrane reducing the effectiveness of the LA, there is also the possibily that their would be no onset of the LA at all.\n",

It aids in increasing the pH levels within the oral cavity to a more optimal level. its protective function is its ability to buffer acids and maintain neutral levels<br/><br/>lubrication<br/><br/>* the mucous secreted by the salivary glands, act as lubrication. This is a protective factor as it lubricates all surface of the oral cavity and also acts as a physical barrier protecting not only soft tissue but hard tissue.<br/><br/>pellicle formation<br/><br/>* the pellicle forms from glycoproteins and other components from sailva. it is formed on clean enamel surface, usually right after brushing.

      "Processing Question 20: A 42-year-old patient attends her appointment with you and has recently been diagnosed with temporomandibular disorder.There is one part to this question. Please respond in the box below. How is this diagnosis defined and how is it different from odontogenic pain? (10 Marks) with answer: Temporomandibular Disorder (TMD) is a group of presenting complaints by patients that involve the TMJ, Muscles of Mastication (MOM) and other associated orofacial structures. TMD is a type of Non-Odontogenic pain because it does not stem from the dentino-pulp complex or periapical tissues.<br/><br/>This diagnosis is defined through specific characteristics such as: TMJ inflammation, tenderness of MOM, difficulty opening and closing the jaw, potential disc displacement etc. The Pt may present with pain upon opening and closing the TMJ during E/O examination and may experience tenderness and clicking/locked jaw. This diagnosis would be determined through reported tenderness in structures such as the temporomandibular joint, and/or MOM, no periapical radiolucencies, normal healthy response to sensibility tests (e.g no lingering pain), no inflammation of gingiva associated with the TMJ pain.<br/><br/>This is significantly different to odontogenic pain in the way that it presents. Odontogenic pain stems from the dentino-pulp complex and associated soft tissue structures. Odontogenic pain may involve pain upon biting, potential suppuration/pus or inflammation of the periodontal tissues, generally odontogenic pain is localised to a specific area e.g lower right molars, and can be associated with endodontic or periodontal conditions. Odontogenic pain can have a lingering, or sharp response to sensibility tests, may display signs of radiolucency, and may present with I/O swelling.<br/><br/>Patients with TMD may need to maintain extra care, preventing excessive chewing e.g constantly chewing gum, minimising widening of the jaw, using a heat pack and pain relief e.g 1g paracetamol as needed. TMD patients may also experience a flare up in their jaw pain post dental check ups, due to prolonged widening of the mouth, pts must be explained that this can occur, and pts must take breaks as needed during the check up to avoid flare up within the TMJ structures.\n",

Please respond in the box below and label each A and B.A. After completion of a Right-Hand Side Inferior Alveolar Nerve block you observe the patient has unilateral facial paralysis on the same side as injection.Outline why this has occurred and the most important consideration in managing this. (6 Marks)B. Cindy is 5 and needs and extraction of the 54. She has buccal facial swelling.Would this Impact the onset and effectiveness of local anaesthesia at this site. why/why not? (4 marks) with answer: A. This is a potential risk factor that can occur during LA delivery known as Bells Palsy. Bells Palsy is the temporary unilateral facial paralysis as a result of accidentally injected the parotid gland during IAN administration. The parotid gland is located posterior to the Inferior alveolar nerve, and injecting into this gland can result in temporary facial paralysis. monitoring this condition and ensuring that it resolves with time is important, allso Instructing the patient to use an eyepatch on the right eye to help cover it and protect it from dust particles etc, as well as removing any eye contacts will be ectremely important to prevent any damage to the eye. Reassuring the patient that this will resolve, and has happened to other patients before is important in allowing the patient to not feel stressed about this adverse effect.<br/><br/><br/><br/>B. Yes this buccal facial swelling may affect LA onset and effectiveness. If the Buccal swelling is on the Right hand side (where the LA will be to extract the 54) then it is likely that LA delivery will be affected. Swelling is an inflammatory response initiated by the immune system to protect structures. Buccal swelling may be an indication of the presence of an abscess, or infection. The pH of these tissues is likely to be much lower (Acidic) which can impact LA delivery. LA can exist in ionised and non ionised forms. But only the non ionised form is able to pass through the nerve cell membrane to the site of action. Due to the buccal swelling, if the pH of the tissues is decreased then this will shift equilibirum towards the ionised form, which means decreased amount of LA will be able to cross the membrane and depolarise nerve potentiation. This may result in delayed onset or even failed LA.\n",

Please respond in the box below and label each A and B.A. What medications do you recommend for him for pain relief? Outline your choice of drug(s), and the dose and frequency. (5 marks)B. Explain the rationale for your choice. (5 marks) with answer: I would recommend 400mg Ibuprofen + 1g Paracetamol, taken 3x daily, on a regular basis for upto the first 5 days after Mr AB's scaling and root planning procedure. Non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID's) are the first line of recommended medications for acute, nociceptive pain. Ibuprofen particularly is recommended because it is generally well tolerated within the body, I recommend that Mr AB have this together with paracetamol to allow for a synergistic, prolonged analgesic effect. NSAIDs have three main mechanisms of actions: Analgesic (reduced nociceptor sensitisation), Anti-inflammatory (Decreased prostaglandins, resulting in reduction in oedema), and anti-pyretic effects (preventing the onset of fever etc).<br/><br/>I have only recommended that Mr AB use this for upto 5 days, Because NSAIDs are only designed for acute (short term) analgesic pain relief, prolonged use of NSAIDs can lead to increased renal, CV, and Kidney effects).<br/><br/>Since Mr AB does not take any medications, or no medical conditions have been presented, NSAIDs should be safe for him to use, as there are no major contraindications outlined. It will help address is concern about feeling pain post treatment, due to the mentioned analgesic effects of NSAIDs, the neuronal excitability is reduced due to reduced nociceptor sensitatisation by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2, and reducing prostanglandin synthesis, thus Mr AB will experience reduced pain.<br/><br/>Ultimately, my rationale for this reccomended medication, is that it's the recommended medication for acute, dental pain and will be beneficial to providing pain relief for Mr AB.\n",

Please respond in the box below.Based on this information, what questions would you want to ask you patient and provide a rationale for each question? (10 marks) with answer: 1.Do you experience Gastrix Reflux when you are lying down for a prolonged amount of time?Since Ms KB is presenting for an examination, which may involve laying in the dental chair for an increased duration, it would be important to gain an understanding of how severely her reflux impacts her ability to lie down. This would then allow me to provide Ms KB with rest breaks as needed during the procedure, allowing her to sit up for a while, or providing a neck pillow to keep her head more elevated.<br/><br/>2.Have you previously ever taken any form of Bisphosphonates for Osteoporosis? If yes, how long ago?Bisphosphonates are another type of medication taken for osteoporosis that inhibit osteoclasts, and promote osteoblasts to increase bone density. However bisphosphonates have a long half life in the body, and bind to bone for prolonged amount of times. Therefore to assess her risk for MRONJ (medication related osteonecrosis of the jaw) it is important to understand whether bisphosphonates may potentially still be present within her body. If they were taken in the past 4 years ago, then this is a risk factor for MRONK.<br/><br/>3. Have you ever had any form of radiation exposure (x-rays)to your face/head/neck?Determining whether Ms KB has had any radiation to the maxillofacial region is another crucial factor in understanding her risk of MRONJ.<br/><br/>4.Have you had any recent dental tx, for example any extractions? If yes, how long ago?It is important to understand if there is any current bone exposure present for longer than 8 weeks again associated with the risk of MRONJ.<br/><br/>Questions 2-4 have been asked to determine MRONJ risk because the criteria for potential MRONJ is: 1) Taken previously or currently any antiogenic/antiresorptive agents, prolia, bisphosphonates etc. 2) Bone exposure for longer than 8 weeks. 3) No history of radiation to the maxillofacial region.<br/><br/>5. How long have you been taking Prolia injections for? When was the last injection? It is important that Ms KB is taking her prolia injections as regularly as required and that they are not delayed to help control osteoporosis. Additionally, asking when her last injection was would aid in understanding the levels of prolia in her body at the time of the appointment. As Prolia is typically at reduced levels 3-4 weeks after the injection, which might be relevant to understanding if certain procedures can be completed at certain times.\n",

      "Processing Question 26: There is one part to this question. Please respond in the box below.Which components of saliva contribute to its protective functions within the oral cavity? Briefly state how. (10 marks) with answer: Saliva is an incredibly important protective component of the oral cavity.<br/><br/>5 Major Protective functions/components of saliva include:<br/><br/>* Role in digestion -> Amylase is a enzyme within saliva that aids in the breakdown of fermentable carbohydrates, this allows for digestion.<br/><br/>* Role inLubrication ->coats teeth to prevent mineral loss in tooth to tooth contact<br/><br/>* Acts as a solvent -> Allows food to be easily swallowed by essentially wrapping up food into a bolus so it can be swallowed and digested.<br/><br/>* Role in neutralising acids/buffering capacity ->explained below<br/><br/>Saliva actually functions in a circadian rhythm manner, where different glands are activated at different times of the day to allow for optimal functioning of saliva. The parotid gland is the major salivary gland that is stimulated during the day, and upon mechanical stimulated. This gland releases proline rich proteins, enzymes such as lysozymes and statherin to be able help digest food and aid in remineralisation. Contrastingly the submandibular gland is activated during the night where it releases mucin rich, thick saliva to provide lubrication while humans are sleeping to prevent tooth loss due to excessive grinding/bruxism (tooth to tooth contact).<br/><br/>Saliva plays a significant role in maintaining a neutral pH within the oral cavity, and promoting remineralisation/preventing demineralisation. For example if a child was to eat a biscuit, this would result in a drop in pH below critical pH (5.5) due to increased bacterial acid present in the oral cavity which can lead to enamel demineralisation (due to a diffusion of calcium and phosphate ions out of the enamel. However, as per the Stephan Curve, although this may lead to a drop in pH, saliva can actually help bring it back up after a period of time back to neural pH (near a pH of 7). This is done as the parotid gland is active upon mechanical digestion, releasing serous, watery, bicarbonate rich saliva. The HCO3 Ions help raise the pH back towards neutral as the Ca2+And PO43- are able to move from the saliva to the plaque fluid and into the enamel fluid where they are able to prevent demineralisation by working to strengthen the enamel and increase its resistance to the acid bacteria present, by doing this they promote remineralisation, and eventually help neutralise the acid.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The flow of Saliva is controlled by acinar cells, and based on whether the Sympathetic or Parasympathetic NS is dominant, different types of glands are activated. For example Sympathetic NS dominance -> via neurotransmitter Noradrenaline -> leads to parotid gland saliva secretion e.g more enzyme rich, this occurs when an indvidual is stressed, anxious, excited. Whereas Parasympathetic NS dominance -> via acetycholine occurs during rest/digest leading to a greater production of viscous saliva.\n",

      "Processing Question 27: You are providing your patient with oral hygiene instructions and encourage the use of a fluoridated toothpaste twice daily. They want to know why they need to use a fluoride paste and you tell them the addition of fluoride can make the tooth mineral stronger.There are two parts to this question. Please respond in the box below and label each A and B.A. When thinking about fluorapatite formation, how does fluoride become incorporated into the hydroxyapatite crystal and why is fluorapatite stronger and more resistant to acid attack? 5 marksB. The progression of demineralisation of enamel can be influenced by which factors? 5 marks with answer: Flouride is a highly beneficial ingredient found in toothpaste that can help strengthen enamel. Fluorapatite is formed when fluoride is readily available and is able to replace to the OH- ions within Hydroxyapatite -> transforming into Fluorapatite. Fluorapatite is stronger because it has a tighter crystal lattice than Hydroxyaptite crystals, meaning it is more resistant to acid and does not dissolve/breakdown as readily as hydroxyapatite can. The tighter structure means bacterial acid cannot penetrate the structure as easily as Hydroxyapatite.<br/><br/>Various factors can affect the demin of enamel:<br/><br/>1) pH of the oral cavity -> A lower pH (more acidic) will lead to greater demineralisation of enamel as calcium and phosphate ions will diffuse out of the enamel quicker in a low pH (below critical), as they are not incredibly resistant to acid<br/><br/>2) The enamel porosity -> Enamel has microscopic pores in their structure which allow both ions and acids to pentrate into them thus allowing for demineralisation/remineralisation. With age the enamel porosity decreases as the uptake of fluid is increased resulting in smaller intercrystalline spaces. This means that with age, enamel is generally more reistant to demineralisation as there is not much space for the acid to penetrate through and dissolve the mineral.<br/><br/>3) Amount of saliva present -> Reduced salivary flow (hyposalivation) due to drugs, medical conditions etc can lead to greater enamel demineralisation, this is because there is reduced bioavailable calcium and phosphate ions that can readily dissolve into the enamel to inhibit demineralisation.<br/><br/>4) Presence of Fluoride -> greater amounts of stable fluoride available e.g through the increased use of CPP-ACP can lead to reduced demineralisation af the formation of Fluorapatitie can occur which reduces the dissolving of enamel mineral.\n",

Please respond in the box below. How is this diagnosis defined and how is it different from odontogenic pain? (10 Marks) with answer: 1. Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) refer to muscoskeletal pain attributed to the muscles and joints associated with the jaw. The diagnosis is defined based of various extra oral and intra oral signs and symptoms. Extraoral findings that would indicate TMD include crepitus or pain associated with the temporomandibular joint upon opening or closing. Additionally, tenderness upon palpating the muscles of mastication (masseter, temporalis, medial and lateral pterygoid) is another manifestation of TMD. Facial analysis, for instance a braoder jaw or assymetry in the jaw where one side is more pronounced than the other, can also indicate habits that are associated with TMD, such as bruxism where an individual grinds their teeth. Such habits can also be indicated by intraoral findings such as linea alba and attrition. However, bruxism does not always mean an individual has TMD, hence it is also important to assess pain as that is a defining characteristic. This is assessed through pain assessment, where the patient is asked about the site of pain, onset, characteristics, radiation of the pain, aggrevating and relieving factors, timing of when the pain comes and fades and severity.<br/><br/>TMD is a musckeloskeletal disorder, hence differs from odontogenic pain which is associated with the dentinopulp complex of teeth and the surroudning peridontium. However, the patient may perceive pain expereinced due to TMD to be attributed to an odontogenic source given the proximity of the jaw joints and mucles to the teeth. Therefore, it is vital these conditions can be differentiated. This can be achieved through performing pulp tests, such as CO2 testing, tenderness to percussion and tenderness to palpation, and using a fracfinder to elimiate the probability of any cracks in the tooth leading to odontogenic infection. A basic periodontal examination would also allow the clinician to screen for periodontal diseases to also furhter eliminate this possibility. Key information from the patient that are red flags indicating TMD would be the feeling of pain upon pressure and the pain not being localised, hence it is important to combine all information to come to the most correct diagnosis.\n",

(6 Marks)B. Cindy is 5 and needs and extraction of the 54. She has buccal facial swelling.Would this Impact the onset and effectiveness of local anaesthesia at this site. why/why not? (4 marks) with answer: A. Unilateral facial paralyiss is attributed to the local anaestheisa (LA) anaesthetising the facial nerve. This nerve passes along the parotid gland where it branches off to supply the muscles of the face. When performing an Inferior alveolar Nerve (IAN) block, the point of insertion is in the pterygomandibular depression, where hte needle enters the pterygomandibular space. The parotid gland is the posterior border of this landmark. Hence, the LA had diffused too posteriorly likely tdue to the needle being inserted too deep, causing it to reach and anaesthetise the facial nerve. The most important consideration in managing this is to ensure the patient is not caused any harm due to the temporary paralysis they are experiencing. For instance, the muscles association with blinking and closing the eyes would be paralysed, hecne the patient should be advised to wear an eye patch while the anaesthesia wears off to prevent any risk of harm to the eyes. The patient should also be comforted by the clinican that this should wear off and is not permanent paralysis<br/><br/>B. The onset and effectiveness of LA at the site would be impaired, as buccal facial swelling is an indication of acute odontogenic infection that has spread systemically. Infections decrease tissue pH due to the increase in hydrogen ions wihtin that area. LA has a pka value hwere there is 50/50 ionised and unionised components. The anaesthesia comppnents need to be unionised to be able to cross the nerve cell membranes. As such, when the LA is injected in the site of infection where tissue pH more acidic, the tissue pH is a greater value away form the LA pka value. This causes the LA components to be more likely to become ionised prior being able to cross the cell membrane of nerve cells that are targetted, meaning their intended effect of nerve impulse inhibition is compormised. This means LA onset may be longer and it would be less effective.\n",

Patient reports twice daily use of an electric toothbrush only for plaque control. You review the periodontal status and record the following probing depths with bleeding noted at all sites surrounding the implant. Clinical findings from investigations are documented below. There are two parts to this question. Please respond in the box below and label each A and BA, Based solely on the information you have, what is your presumptive diagnosis and supporting rationale? (4 Marks)B. Outline the main treatment goal and preventative advice, providing supporting rationale. (6 Marks) with answer: A. Peri-mucosititis. This is as bleeding was reported at all sites surroudning the implant, indicating soft tissue pathology. The patient would not have peri-implantitis given the absence radiographic bone loss progression and deeper pocket dpeths upon the 12 months review<br/><br/>B. The main treatment goal would be to stop the patients bleeding gums. The patient is currently only burshing 2x a day with an electirc toothbrush, hence preventative advice I would privde would be to introduce interdental brushing. This would ensure enhanced plaue control in interproximal areas which are not easily cleansable with regular tooth brushing. I would also ask the patient to demonstrate and explain their brushing technique to ensure they are brushing for two minutes a day mornig and night with the proper technique. Upon doing so, I would observe to see of the patient brushes each tooth surface for atlest 3 seconds and brushing near the gingival margin with the brush head angled around 45 degree. This advice seeks to wnsure the patient has optimal plaque control. The rationale behind this is that the bleeding around the implant is likely associated with inflammation caused by bacteria in plaque that may be missed when brushing. This inflammation can subside by enhancing oral hygience, and I would want the patient to manage this before possible progression of the inflammation into peri-implantitis if it becomes chronic.\n",

I would also probe around the tooth to observe bleeding on probing and suppuration. I would also recommed more focused oral hygience practices on the tooth including thorough toothbrushing twice a day and flossing where possible. If the patient communicates they cannot brush the tooth as it is too painful i would recommend using chlorohexidine mouthrinse until treatment (unless treatment will be in over 2-3 weeks)<br/><br/>Intermediate maangement would include referral for the tooth to be possibly removed. I would also refer the patient for prescription of analgesics (e.g ibuprofen and paracetamol if not contraindicated) if treatment cannot be provided for a prolonged period.\n",

They want to know why they need to use a fluoride paste and you tell them the addition of fluoride can make the tooth mineral stronger.There are two parts to this question. Please respond in the box below and label each A and B.A. When thinking about fluorapatite formation, how does fluoride become incorporated into the hydroxyapatite crystal and why is fluorapatite stronger and more resistant to acid attack? 5 marksB. The progression of demineralisation of enamel can be influenced by which factors? 5 marks with answer: A. For flurapatite to form, there. needs to be initial deminieralisation so that the initial hydorxyapaptite crystal can be replaced. Demineralisation of hydroxyapatite is caused by an undesaturation of ions (calcium, phosphate, hydroxide) in the enamel fluid, causing an equilibrium-driven breakdown of the crystal into its ions. These ions diffuse outwards towards the enamel and can be lost if not bound together to form a new crystal. Fluoride can replace the hydroxide component of hydroxyapatite and bind to calcium and phosphate to form fluorapatite. Loose fluoride can be present on the enamel surface and bioavailable through topical application, such through fluoridated toothpaste or fluoride varnishes and gels. As such, those ions diffusing out of the tooth towards the enamel surface are prevented from being completely lost through the loose fluoride ions binding to the calcium and phosphate. Fluaride has a greater affinity towards these ions than hydroxyapatite, causing stronger crystal struture that has a tighter crystal lattice. These structural advanatages further allows to fluoraptite to have a lower critical pH than hydroxyapatie, meaning it is more resistant to acid attack since more acid would need to be present to actually cause the fluorapatie to begin to demineralise<br/><br/>B. Saliva influences demineralisation progression due to its many effects including:<br/><br/>* buffering as it contian bicarbonate (increasing the oral pH by decreasing hydrogen ion concentration)<br/><br/>* cleansing through helping to remove the bacteria on the teeth<br/><br/>* inhibiting demineralisation through its antimicrobial properties (e.g lyzoyme, mucins)<br/><br/>Hence, individual with hyposalivation would have a greater prgression of demineralisation<br/><br/>Another factor influencing demineralisation is dietary habits. Individuals with diets high and frequent glucose intake provide a constant food source for bacteria, which allowes them to undergo constant metabolism (glycolyis) and produce lactic acid which decreases the oral pH. Additionally, the type of bacteria present can cause a greater progression of demineralisation. Furthermore, oral hygiene practies greatly influence deminteralisation progression sine poorer oral hygiene causes greater plaque levels to be present and a more mature biofilm.\n",

(6 Marks)B. Cindy is 5 and needs and extraction of the 54. She has buccal facial swelling.Would this Impact the onset and effectiveness of local anaesthesia at this site. why/why not? (4 marks) with answer: A) Unilateral facial paralysis was due to incorrect technique and injecting the IAN block too posteriorly into the parotid gland where the facial nerve passes (facial nerve innervates muscles responsible for facial expressions so when it is anesthetised this results in inability to form expressions and facial drooping). To manage this I would calmly explain to the patient what has happened and reassure them that the effects are not permanent and will likely go away when the anesthesia wears off in 3 to 4 hours. I would closely monitor them until the anesthesia wears off and I would also provide them with an eye patch to prevent the eyes from drying out (as they won't be able to close their eyes due to the effect of the anesthesia).<br/><br/><br/><br/>B) Yes, because facial swelling indicates spreading odontogenic infection so the the pH will be low (acidic environment) meaning that the majority of the LA will be ionised and won't be able to penetrate the tissues and excert its action (only unionised form of LA can penetrate) so this results in delayed action or no action at all of the LA.\n",

The progression of demineralisation of enamel can be influenced by which factors? 5 marks with answer: A) When fluoride is introduced to the tooth surfaces it diffuses across the pellicle layer into enamel surface and causes the solution to become supersaturated with respect to fluoroapatite formation. In the presence of calcium and phosphate it promotes remineralisation by encouraging the lost minerals to be re-incorporated into the tooth. Fluoroapatite is stronger and more resistant to acid attacks because it is more supersaturated and has less solubility for the same molar ratio compared to all salts.<br/><br/>B) The progression of demineralisation of enamel can be influenced by pathogenic factors such as plaque accumulation, poor oral hygiene and not exposing the teeth surfaces to fluoride, frequent sugar consumption and fermented carbohydrates, poor saliva defences due to some diseases that reduce saliva production or medication usage that reduce saliva formation, not drinking water enough to wash the acid away from the tooth surfaces.\n",

Nocicpetive pain is a normal pain response to a noxious stimuli such as caries.<br/><br/>Odontogenic pain can often be treated by the removal of a noxious stimuli (e.g. caries, abscess) to resolve the pain. TMD pain must be addressed by other factors which could include: reducing stress, anxiety, bruxism habits, malocclusion etc<br/><br/>Odontogenic pain is often localised to the site within the oral cavity unless there is spreading infection present, whereas TMD pain usually presents as unilateral and more generalised with potential referred pain. For example, the temporalis can refer pain to cause headaches and percieved maxillary tooth pain.<br/><br/>Quality of pain is often different. TMD is more dull, achy pain - attributed to its musco-skeletal origin, where as odontogenic pain can be more of a spontaneous sharp, lingering/non-lingering pain.<br/><br/>Exacerbation factors vary.

COX 2 is responsible for the inflammatory prostaglandins released.Ibuprofen in combination with paracetamol has a synergetic effect, therefore is more effective each of the drugs taken seperately.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n",

Please respond in the box below. How is this diagnosis defined and how is it different from odontogenic pain? (10 Marks) with answer: 1. This diagnosis is defined by the pain the patient feels in their temporomandibular joint and surrounding muscles which include the muscles of mastication. The patient undergoes a range of tests and observations to confirm temporomandibular disorder. These could include palpating the masticating muscles and the TMJ when opening and closing to see if there is tenderness. When theres clicking and pain associated with opening and closing the jaw, TMD may be the cause. And observing the changes there may be at a range of different appoinments to confirm if the patient has TMD. Hence, TMD is different to odontogenic pain as TMD affects the muscles and the temporomandibular joint. Whereas, odontogenic pain stems from the dentine, peridontal ligament and pulp as it involves the cells and tubules present in these areas. Therefore, odonotogenic pain is more localised and specific to the tooth, in comparison to TMD which may affect one or both temporomandibular joints.\n",

(6 Marks)B. Cindy is 5 and needs and extraction of the 54. She has buccal facial swelling.Would this Impact the onset and effectiveness of local anaesthesia at this site. why/why not? (4 marks) with answer: A. This may have occured as the LA injected into the Inferior Alveolar nerve (IAN) may have hit the lingual nerve which runs directly above the IAN and therefore has caused paralysis on half the tongue. Similarly, a long buccal block may have been given to the patient after the IAN block to numb the buccal gingival mucosa. Hence, the LA may have diffused and further cause paralysis on the cheek and surrounding areas. Additionally, the patient may have been given more LA than required, hence causing a prolonged paralysis of the RHS. Consideration in managing this may be to inform the patient on the outcomes and assure that the facial paralysis will fade in a couple more hours. Additionally, if the paralysis persists after the normal range for LA 'numbness' then referral to a GP or specialist may be required.<br/><br/>B. The buccal facial swelling may impact the onset and effectiveness of LA if an infection is involved in the swelling. Infection causes the pH of the affected mucosa and surrounding areas to drop making it more acidic. The acidic enviornment reduces the possibility of the non-ionised LA molecules to diffuse through the nerve cells, resulting in the onset of the LA to increase significantly. This would mean that it would take a longer time for the LA to 'work' and numb the patient. Similarly, an infection causes there to be an increase in blood flow, due to the vasoconstriction. Hence, this reduces the effectiveness of LA. However, if the reasoning behind the facial swelling is not inflammation and infection, then it might be hard to reach the site of the targeted nerve, hence making it difficult to give LA to the patient.\n",

This question is important as it would highlight the period in which prolia was taken and hence the risk the patient may be in when it comes to MRONJ<br/><br/>2. If the patient takes any biphosphonatest: The patient may be at risk for MRONJ as the biphosphonates attach themselves to the hydroapatitie which results in the osteoclasts absorbing th biphophonates instead of the hydroapatitie. This results in the being a decrease in bone remodelling and therefore a higher chance of getting MRONJ. Additionally, even if the patient has taken a biphosphonate years ago, they still are at risk for MRONJ as the half life of biphosphonates are longer. Meaning it may still be in their system which puts them at risk.<br/><br/>3. If the patients takes Denosumab: which is also a risk factor of MRONJ. Denosumab inhibits RANKL which is an enzyme that promotes osteoclast activity. Osteoclasts are essential in the formation of new bone, hence putting the patient at risk for MRONJ. Denosumab having a shorter half life compared to biphosphonates, meaning it'll still be in the patients system for atleast a year. Hence, if the patient has taken Denosumab recently, theyre at risk for MRONJ.<br/><br/>4.

(4 Marks)B. Outline the main treatment goal and preventative advice, providing supporting rationale. (6 Marks) with answer: A. Peri-implant mucotitis: This is when there is inflammation of the gingiva. This is due to the fact that the probing depths around the impant have not reduced, suggests that there is inflammation on the gingiva. As there is not image of the gingiva, the inflammation around the implant is only assumed. Additionally, the radiograph illustrates the same bone levels in both the baseline and 12 months after recall, suggesting that the diagnosis cannot be peri-implantitis as that involves bone loss. Hence, the patients use of an electric toothbrush only for plaque control may indicate that the patient may only use the electric toothbrush when there is an accumulation of plaque on there teeth suggesting the patients lack of motivation to improve the health of their gingiva around their implant and rest of mouth.<br/><br/>B. The main treatment goal is to reduce the probing depths and keep the maximum probing depth at a 4. Hence the preventative advice would be that the patient brushes their teeth twice daily regardless of the plaque accumulation as the patient only brushed for plaque control.

Outline your initial and intermediate management of this patient as an Oral Health Therapist (6 Marks) with answer: A. Pericoronal abscess. This is because of the swelling, pus and inflammation around the partially erupted third molar. Pericoronal abscess usually forms closer to the crown of the tooth in the surrounding peridontal spaces, which is illustrated in the image above. Additionally, pericoronal abscess usually forms on partially erupted molars as bacteria and food particles may get trapped in the flap that is present when the tooth is emerging.<br/><br/>B. Initial management of this patient is to do a scale and clean debridement. This would clean out any of the pus that is remaining in that space and therefore remove the source of the inflammation and pus which may be the bacteria and food trapped. Additionally, OHI instructions is required to ensure that patient knows how clean the partially erupted tooth properly so that they do not get pericoronal abscess again. Intermediate management would the 6-12 month recall to do a scale and clean debridement which would properly remove any future trapped food particles or bacteria. Additionally, if the pericoronal abscess persists and the tooth is not emerging at a faster rate, a small surgery like a gingivectomy can be done to remove the excess gingiva at the back of the third molar.

This may eventually need to pulp necrosis.<br/><br/>However, this differs to non-odontogenic pain as this pain is not related to the teeth or a specific tooth. Non-odontogenic pain can be related to other causes such as muscles, which may affect the movement or optimal functioning of the mouth or other body parts.

(6 Marks)B. Cindy is 5 and needs and extraction of the 54. She has buccal facial swelling.Would this Impact the onset and effectiveness of local anaesthesia at this site. why/why not? (4 marks) with answer: A. This has occured due to the placement of the needle too posteriorly than the needed placement of an IAN block. This means that the needle was placed in the parotid gland, which has the facial nerve running running through it. As the facial nerve controls the movement of the muscles in the face, the side at which the local anaesthsia was inserted into the parotid gland (RHS) paralyses it (not able to move).<br/><br/>The most important consideration in managing this would be to ensure the safety of the patient, ensuring that they are able to breathe whilst reassuring them that it is normal and that it happens. The eye have also been impacted, causing the inability to blink, so a patch over the eye may be placed to stop the eye from drying out. Again, the patient should be reassured and told that movement to the face should come back in around 1-2 hours.<br/><br/>B. Yes, this may impact the onset andand effeectiveness of local anaesthesia (LA) at this site. This is because the swelling is near the site of the 54.<br/><br/>LA works by binding intracellulary to sodium ion-channels located on the cell membranes, not allowing for the channel to open and causing the influc of sodium which leadings to cell depolarisation and the perception of pain. As LA is a weak base, its unionised form is able to pass through the membrane and bind to the sodium ion-channels intracellularly. However, the swelling in this case would indicate an infection, meaning that the local environment of the tissues would include decreased pH (more aciditic environment). As LA is a weak base, much of its concentration may become ionised in the tissue enviornment, not allowing for it to pass through the membrane an bind to the sodium channels to stop the influx of sodium in the cell. This may mean that it will take longer for the LA to take effect or may mean that more LA is needed to provide sufficent anaesthesia.\n",

He is not taking any medications and is a heavy smoker. He does not report any allergies. He is concerned about the pain after treatment.There are two parts to this question. Please respond in the box below and label each A and B.A. What medications do you recommend for him for pain relief? Outline your choice of drug(s), and the dose and frequency. (5 marks)B. Explain the rationale for your choice. (5 marks) with answer: A. Ibeprofen 400mg x3 daily, taken with Paracetamol 1000mg x3 daily without food, for 5 days.<br/><br/>B. Ibeprofen is an non-steiodal anti-inflammatroy drug which inhibits COX1 (important for protection of GI and stomach ining) and COX2 (respond to tissue damage), reducing the production of prostoglandins. This will reduce the affects of inflammation and provide relief for the patient. Paracetaol is an analgesic which also works by inhibiting COX, especially COX2, which also reduces the inflammatory affect and provides pain relief for the patient. It is best to take these without food to allow optimal efficacy of the drugs.<br/><br/>The use of ibeprofen and paracetamol together provides a longer concurrent pain relief which is optimal for the patient due to the history of heavy smoking.\n",

      "Processing Question 23: Ms KB (65 years old) presents to the DTC for a routine examination. This is the first time you have seen the patient. You review the previous notes and note the following:Medical conditions: Osteoporosis, refluxMedications: Prolia for Osteoporosis, Somac for refluxNo other medical conditions or medications and no known allergies reported.There is one part to this question. Please respond in the box below.Based on this information, what questions would you want to ask you patient and provide a rationale for each question? (10 marks) with answer: How long have you been taking the medications? Prolia is a monoclonal antibody, meaning that it allows for increased bone densitry but lowers turnover rate due to the proliferation of osteoclasts and the inhibition of osteoblasts. Due to the half-life of the medication, being on the medication for 4 years will increase the risk of medically-induced osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ).<br/><br/>When was the last time the dosage changed for your medications? Knowing when the last time the dosage changed is helpful in knowing whether or not the medical conditions are someonewhat controlled or uncontrolled. If there is constant dosage and frequency changes, then it is more likely that the condition is not controlled. With uncontrolled reflux, for example, this may lead to an increase in erosion due to the acidity on the teeth which would be important to know and understand for treatment planning.<br/><br/>When was the last time you had your prolia injection? Prolia is generally taken every 6 months. If a more invasive dental procedure was to occur, such as an extraction, it would need to be timed with the injection of the Prolia medication to ensure the most reduced risk of MRONJ.<br/><br/>Do you see a general practitioner regularly?It is important to know if the patient is seeing a GP regularly or not, to ensure the control of the patients medical conditions and medications. It would also be useful as the GP can be used as a mode of contact to know more information on the medications, such as dosage changes, if the patient is unsure.<br/><br/>Have you been cleared by a doctor to have dental treatment?Due to the use of Prolia, it may be best to ask the patient or the patient's general practitioner on whether or not they are cleared to have specific dental treatments completed due to the risk of MRONJ . If, for example, a more invasive treatment is needed later on, the GP would need to clear it.\n",

(4 Marks)B. Outline the main treatment goal and preventative advice, providing supporting rationale. (6 Marks) with answer: A. Presumptive diagnosis of peri-mucasitus due to the higher probing depths, of 4mm, around the tooth. Usually, healthy probing depths are 1-3mm. This would indicate slightly more inflammation in the area around the tooth , however there is no involvment regarding an increase in the loss of bone around the implant.<br/><br/>B. The main treatment goal would be to ensure appropriate plaque control through preventative debridements and oral hygiene for the management of the implant. For debridements, I would ensure to not directly use an EMS around the implant, and instead use hand-instruments (possibly plastic), to ensure no damage is done to the implant whilst removing any buildup. The oral hygiene advice would be to continue the use of an electric toothbrush for the teeth, and around the site of the implant for plaque control. I would also advise flossing to reduce the likeliness of interproximal plaque buildup, which may lead to calculus and later bone loss around the implant site. I would however stress the importnace of not using floss such as superfloss, as this may become stuck interproximally at the site of the implant.\n",

Based solely on the information you have, what is your presumptive diagnosis and supporting rationale? (4 Marks)B. Outline your initial and intermediate management of this patient as an Oral Health Therapist (6 Marks) with answer: A. Presumptive diagnosis of pericoronal abscess. This is because their is visible swelling and redness of the tissue on the distal of the third molar, which is near the crown. Pericoronal abscesses are located near the crown of the tooth, usually appear with redness and swelling of the tissue near the crown and are usually associated with the third molars during their eruption.<br/><br/>B. Initial management would be to ensure the removal or debridement of any plaque or calculus located near the abcess which may be contributing to the bacteria associated with the abcess. I would then drain the abcess if possible and recommond a 0.2% hydrochloric mouth wash to aid in the removal of bacteria from the abcess. I would ask the patient to focus on oral hygiene such as ensuring to brush with a soft bristled manual toothbrush or electric toothbrush in that area x2 a day for 2 mintues. This would be reassessed in 3-5 days to see if the lesion has reduced. If no progress is visible, I would also speak to the dentist about the use of antibiotics, such as amoxcillin 400mg x3 a day, to aid in the system removal of the bacteria from the abcess lesion<br/><br/>Intermediate management would be a referral to a dentist or possibly an orofacial surgeon, depending on the placement of the third molars, for future extraction to reduce the likeliness of the abcess forming again.\n",

Please respond in the box below and label each A and B.A. When thinking about fluorapatite formation, how does fluoride become incorporated into the hydroxyapatite crystal and why is fluorapatite stronger and more resistant to acid attack? 5 marksB. The progression of demineralisation of enamel can be influenced by which factors? 5 marks with answer: A. Fluoride becomes incorporated into the hydroxyapatite crystal when there is dissolution of the hydroxyapatite crystal, causing it to become more porous. This means that the hydrogen within the hydroxiapatite crystal leaves and becomes H-, creating \"gaps\" within the hydroxyapatite crysal and leading to it being more porous. When this occurs, the presence of fluoride will allow for the fluoride to move through the porous apatite crystal, binding to it in replace of the hydrogen ion, to form fluorapatite.<br/><br/>It is stronger and more resistant to acid attack as the fluoride creates a more electronegative crystal, which is less likely to dissolude and become porous. Therefore allowing the crystal to remain strong and flight off acid attack, and fluoride is less likely to move to the acid an hydrogen due to its electronegativity.<br/><br/>B. Can be influenced by factors such as:<br/><br/>* The abscence of fluoride due to its inability to form hydroxyapitite which is stronger more resistant to acid attach<br/><br/>* The lower pH of the surrounding environement below critial pH of 5.5, increasing the progression of demineralisation<br/><br/>* The lack of saliva flow, reducing protective salivary effectss. This includes the buffering capacity of the saliva due to the presence of bicarbonate<br/><br/>* The presence of bacteria, mostly oral streptacocci, which cause the progression of caries<br/><br/>* The presence of food such as iron for the bacteria, which causes the bacteria to grow and reproduce, increasing progression of demineralisation of enamel\n",

Please respond in the box below. How is this diagnosis defined and how is it different from odontogenic pain? (10 Marks) with answer: The diagnosis of TMD is defined through taking a thorough medical, dental and social history as well as clinical various examinations. TMD is a collective complaint of soreness/pain/tenderness around the TMJ, muscle of mastications and other orofacial structures. Therefore, it is defined through:<br/><br/>* medical history: asking the patient when the pain has arised/ if there are any triggers towards the pain/ any relieving factors like soft diet/ if it is spreading to other structures/ rating the pain on a scale of 1-10/ any exacerbating factors, using SOCRATES. Also ask about any medications taken that may exacerbate the pain/discomfort symptoms.<br/><br/>* dental history: any extractions, previous dental work done.<br/><br/>* social history: any stress situations recently (may contribute to bruxism that contributes to TMD).<br/><br/>* E/O: looking around the TMJ (see if any asymmetries and observing for limited opening or not), palpating the TMJ and asking the pt to open and close to feel for any clicking/popping/crepitus. Ask pt if they feel any discomfort or pain upon opening/closing.<br/><br/>* I/O soft tissue: palpate around mucosa to feel for tenderness/discomfort.<br/><br/>* I/O hard tissues (odontogram/visual examination): any attrition/ loss surface details around the occlusal surfaces/ any recession that may contribute to symptoms of TMD.<br/><br/>* Special tests like TTP, palpation around apices, vitality test, PA radiographs to rule out symptoms of pulpitis, radiolucencies around root apical, apical periodontitis (to rule out pain symptoms that may come from the oral cavity).<br/><br/>*<br/><br/>* It is different from odontogenic pain as the cause of TMD does not arise from the oral cavity (dentine or PDL), instead it is most likely to arise from muscle pain (outside of the oral cavity).<br/><br/>* Usually non-odontogenic disorders symptoms like TMD cannot be found with special tests, special tests are usually more useful for odontogenic disorders like caries, periodontal diseases, pulpitis symptoms.

(4 marks) with answer: A. Unilateral facial paralysis is most likely to occur when LA is injected/pierced into a blood vessel (in this case of IAN block, it might be lingual nerve due to close proximity) or overdosing. The consideration in managing this is providing an eye patch to prevent cornea damage as pt might not be able to close one of their eyes, reassuring patient that if symptoms do not improve ensure to call and referral to oral maxillofacial surgeon may be requied. Provide analgesics if patient is experiencing any pain.<br/><br/>B. Yes the presence of buccal facial swelling would impact the onset and effectiveness of LA around the 54 as the swelling usually means there is an infection around the 54. Buccal facial swelling is an infection of the buccal space that can easily spread to the cavernous sinus. When there is an infection, the local pH around the oral cavity tends to lower, this means that the LA ions will become more ionised. Consequently, ionised molecules do not cross the cell membrane easily, thus the local anaesthetic cannot diffuse across the cell membrane which increases the generation of action potentials, leading to more pain perception from the patient. The onset of the LA is reduced due to presence of ionised ions while the effectiveness is delayed as more pain may be perceived by Cindy.\n",

Explain the rationale for your choice. (5 marks) with answer: 1. Ibuprofen 400mg with paracetamol 1g, 4-6 hourly for 3 days<br/><br/>2. As Mr AB does not take any medications and has no relevant allergies, this means it is most likely that he has no contraindications for NSAIDS (which includes kidney impairment, anticoagulants or GI ulcers etc). Therefore, an NSAID along with paracetamol is the most useful (first-line) for analgesia.<br/><br/>* NSAID (ibuprofen) is chosen due to its anti-inflammatory, anagelsic and antipyretic effects. As periodontitis is caused by a host inflammatory response, NSAID helps with reducing the swelling, oedema through reduction of COX1 and 2 enzymes, which in turn reduces prostaglandin production that is resposible for vasodilation and odema. NSAID also has analgesic effect as prostaglandin (PGE2) is reduced, which means the nociceptive nerve endings has decreased response to inflammatory mediators like bradykinin, thereby helping with pain relief.<br/><br/>* Paracetamol is chosen along with NSAID due to their synergic effect for pain relief, even though paracetamol has little to no anti-inflammatory properties, it can provide maximum effect for pain relief/fever, which helps with Mr AB concerns. It is usually first line with NSAID if the pt has no contraindications/allergies/preferences.<br/><br/>* For 3 days is to prevent overdosing, usually taking an NSAID + paracetamol for more than 5 days require a review to check for any allergies/adverse reactions.\n",

Please respond in the box below.Based on this information, what questions would you want to ask you patient and provide a rationale for each question? (10 marks) with answer: 1. How long have you been taking Prolia for osteoporosis?<br/><br/>* Prolia is a denosumab that helps with osteporosis. This question is asked to check if Ms KB is at high risk of developing MRONJ (a condition of jaw failure due to certain medications). As Prolia (denosumab) is a factor that contributes to development of MRONJ, it is important to know how long Mrs AB has been taking it because if she has been taking it for 5 or more years, there is a higher chance of her developing MRONJ.<br/><br/>2. Have you undergone any radiation therapy or are you planning to have one?<br/><br/>* Previous radiation therapy can help with the diagnosis of MRONJ. If Ms KB has radiation therapy for cancer, or ongoing radiation therapy treatment, it is more likely that Mrs KB will develop MRONJ.<br/><br/>*<br/><br/>* 3. Have you undergone any previous dental treatments like extractions, implants, periodontal procedures?<br/><br/>* Rationale: Dental treatments especially extractions and implants are some factors that contribute to MRONJ, especially when Ms KB is taking denosumab as well. If Ms KB has had extractions, implant placement while taking denosumab, there is a high chance of her developing MRONJ.<br/><br/>4. Have you previously took an NSAID (like ibuprofen) while taking somac for refluex?<br/><br/>* NSAID inhibits prostaglandin synthesis which is usually protective for gastric mucosa lining, thus it is usually contraindicated in patients that has GI conditions like reflux. If Ms KB has had history of taking NSAID along with Somac, it increases the risk of GI bleeding and ulcers developing. It is important to note this and advice Ms KB as ibuprofen is commonly bought from individuals for fever, anti-inflammation and pain relief, without knowing its side effect and medication contraindications.<br/><br/>5. Can you describe your diet?<br/><br/>* As Ms KB has the mdical condition of reflux, it is important to proceed with her diet to see if she is consuming any acidic drink or food that may progress into erosion. Intrinsic acid (GI reflux, gastric acid) and extrinsic acid are the greatest contributor of erosion and not many individuals are aware of it.<br/><br/>6. Have you experienced any side effects/symptoms while taking prolia and somac in the past?<br/><br/>* side effects like dizziness, nausea, constipation and vomitting are common while taking medications. It is important to differentiate between side effects and true allergies, ensuring that Mrs KB was not experieicng any true allergies like rashes and anaphylaxis which are important to know to prevent continuous use of prolia and somac.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n",

There are two parts to this question. Please respond in the box below and label each A and BA, Based solely on the information you have, what is your presumptive diagnosis and supporting rationale? (4 Marks)B. Outline the main treatment goal and preventative advice, providing supporting rationale. (6 Marks) with answer: A. Peri-implant mucositis. This is the presumptive diagnosis due to the maximum of 4mm pocking depth recorded buccally and palatally of the implant, which indicates there may be some inflammation occurring around the implant. However, based on the baseline and recent recordings, there is no increase (peri-implantitis is usually pocket depths of 6mm or more) or changes for the pocket depths 12 months after the implant placement (remains 4mm), which indicates that the disease may be stable for now. Moreover, comparing the periapical radioraphs, there is no increase in bone loss around the implant, which rules out the diagnosis of peri-implantitis (where bone loss occurs). The presence of BOP around all sites of the implant suggests another sign of inflammation around the implant (bleeding is a response to inflammation), which supports the diagnosis of peri-implant mucositis, where the implant is not at complete health, instead inflammation and mucositis exist.<br/><br/>B. Treatment goal: control inflammation around the implant. Preventative advice is to start flossing around the implant using an appropriate floss designated for implant, 3 months maintenance and continue brushing for x2 and 2 minutes.<br/><br/>* rationale of my tx goal: Through controlling inflammation in-chair and at home like professional debridement using non-abrasive agents and non-metallic instruments help to reduce plaque/calculus that may present subgingivally, it can reverse the diagnosis back to implant health. Ultimately, it helps to prevent peri-implant mucositis from progressing to peri-implantitis, which is a progressive inflammation that involves irreversible bone loss, potential loss of implant and pain.<br/><br/>* rationale of my advice: flossing around the implant can reduce amount of plaque accumulating around the implant, which is the main cause of inflammation that causes peri-implant diseases. Thus encouraging flossing helps with inflammation. Continuining to brush x2 a day helps with removing supragingival plaque, especially around the gum line that can be easily accumulated.\n",

Outline your initial and intermediate management of this patient as an Oral Health Therapist (6 Marks) with answer: A. Pericoronal abscess (pericoronitis)<br/><br/>Pericoronal abscess usually occurs around a partially erupted tooth, like 3rd molars. Swelling and redness around the mucosa distal to the 3rd molar indicates pericoronitis. This rules out the diagnosis of periodontal abscess that usually occurs within an existing periodontal pocket and periapical abscess that is seen around the apex of a root tip. Swelling and redness further suggest that it is inflammation and not other infections like caries or non-odontogenic infections as swelling and redness usually occur as a response to plaque accumulation that triggers a host-inflammatory response.<br/><br/>B.<br/><br/>* Initial management: irrigate with 0.2% hydrogen peroxide/CHX solution/ sterile solution, recontour opposing tooth or referral for extraction of the 3rd molar or opposing tooth (based on pt preference/pain severity), OHI (use soft bristles toothbrush, CHX mouthrinse if unable to brush the back due to severe pain, otherwise continue brushing 2 minutes with fluoride toothpaste).

Briefly state how. (10 marks) with answer: The components of saliva that contribute to its protective function is the ions (bicarbonate mainly), proteins and antimicrobial components. The proteins involve mucin, amylase, cystatin, statherin and proline rich protein (PRP). The antimicrobial components involve lgA, lactoferrin, lysozyme and peroxidase.<br/><br/>* Mucin: can be divided into MG1 and MG2. MG1 mainly helps with lubrication pellicle formation while MG2 mainly has antimicrobial properties. Lubrication protects the oral cavity from abrasion of the tooth surfaces, dysphagia and xerostomia. Lubrication also helps with speech and chewing which is important for the oral cavity. The formation of an acquired pellicle layer can selectively choose which bacteria enters the enamel surface, reducing cariogenic bacteria presence and also slows down acid diffusion, which protects enamel from demineralisation.<br/><br/>* Amylase: aids in digestion by breaking down starch, ensuring that bacteria does not metabolise on carbs that will in turn produce acid that contributes to loss of minerals.<br/><br/>* Lactoferrin: binds to iron, which is a nutrient for bacteria to grow, thus depriving bacteria's nutrient and leads to bacteriostatic, demineralisation occurs slower.<br/><br/>* Lysozyme: disrupts peptidoglycan bacterial cell wall, which ruptures cell wall leading to bactericidal, reducing the amount of cariogenic bacteria in the oral cavity.<br/><br/>* Bicarbonate ions acts as a pH buffer system that resist pH changes (avoid pH from decreasing) by forming carbonic acid. This helps to maintain pH at neutral and prevent acidity pH. Therefore, protects the oral cavity as the environment is less favourable for cariogenic bacteria like S.mutans to grow and proliferate.<br/><br/>* Statherin: can bind to calcium and phosphate and prevent them from precipitating from the surface. Calcium and phosphate are important ions that can help with remineralisation (adding minerals back into the HAP crystals).<br/><br/>* PRPs: lubrication effects, stabilise ions, prevent calculus formation thus proteting oral cavity from developing gingivitis/periodontitis.\n",

      "Processing Question 27: You are providing your patient with oral hygiene instructions and encourage the use of a fluoridated toothpaste twice daily. They want to know why they need to use a fluoride paste and you tell them the addition of fluoride can make the tooth mineral stronger.There are two parts to this question. Please respond in the box below and label each A and B.A. When thinking about fluorapatite formation, how does fluoride become incorporated into the hydroxyapatite crystal and why is fluorapatite stronger and more resistant to acid attack? 5 marksB. The progression of demineralisation of enamel can be influenced by which factors? 5 marks with answer: A Fluoride is incorporated into the hydroxyapatite crystal through passive diffusion into the enamel surface via topical application, then replacing OH- ions in the crystal and due to its higher charge density, it binds more tightly, thus producing fluorapatite (FAP). FAP is stronger and more resistant to acid attack due to its lower solubility properties, this means that it is less likely to be dissolved when acid is present.<br/><br/>B. Progression of demineralisation can be influenced by:<br/><br/>* pH level: when pH level is very low, that means more mineral ions interact with H+ ions and diffuse out of the hydroxyapatite crystals, this leads to a more rapid progression of demineralisation.<br/><br/>* Amount of calcium/phosphate ions loss/present in plaque: lower amount of calcium and phosphate ions present means the hydroxyapatite crystal surface is more, thus exacerbating dem process.<br/><br/>* saliva buffering capacity and flow: if there is little bicarb ions present, pH around the saliva can easily lower, allowing bacteria to produce more acid, thus favouring dem process. Less saliva present means there are less protective ions to help to arrest dem process.<br/><br/>* amount of fluoride ions given topically/present: fluoride ions can slow down the progression of demineralisation by binding to the ions in hydroxyapatite crystals and forming FAP and resisting acid attack.<br/><br/>* type of microbial community present: cariogenic bacteria like S.mutans contributes more to acid production that leads to dem progressing faster.\n",

Please respond in the box below and label each A and B.A. When thinking about fluorapatite formation, how does fluoride become incorporated into the hydroxyapatite crystal and why is fluorapatite stronger and more resistant to acid attack? 5 marksB. The progression of demineralisation of enamel can be influenced by which factors? 5 marks with answer: A: the reason of having fluoridate toothpaste is dur the the toothpaste contain fluoride F-, these fluoride will diffuse in our enamel and contributer with hydroxyapatite, the chemical fomular Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 to Ca10(PO4)6F2+OH-. the fluorapatite will form priority than hydroxyapatite, it forms a more tightly and stronger chemical fomular structure that is harder to break down by H+ ions. It will increase the critical PH from 5.5 to 4.5 which result in more resistant to acid enviorment. Moreover the OH- that been release from convention from hydroxyapatite to fluorapatite could also slightly increase the PH level surrouding.<br/><br/>B: The progression of demineralisation of enamel can be influenced by multifactor, that include diet, bacteria and host factor. In first people consume food, carbohydrate in the food can be digested to sucrose. This surgary product will be energy for bacteria such as streptococcus. These bacteria will release H+ ions as side product which will deacrese the oral cavity PH. once the oral cavity PH drop below 5.5 the hydroxyapatie Ca10 (PO4)6(OH)2 will likely to break down to 6CaPHO +2H2O+4Ca2 and another break down from CaPHO to Ca2+ + H2PO. These small ions like calcium and phosphate are likely to level the enamel due to lower consentration in outside enviorment. This is deminerlisation and caries will from if process left for prolonger. However the salivary will buffer the PH level back to neutral and fluoride intake will make enamel more resistant to acid result in less deminerlisation.\n",

(10 Marks) with answer: 1. this diagnosis is defined as pain and dysfunction in regards to the muscles of mastication, temporomandibular joint and other associated orofacial structures. Pain may be mylgesic (only in the muscles), arthergesic (only in the cartridge) or located in the TMJ. TMD usually affects the opening pattern of the mouth, it determines how much an individual can open and close their mouth- and may be an exacerbating condition in which an individual's quality of life is reduced.<br/><br/>Parafunction may exacerbate the condition as it refers to the activity/use of these structures in ways other than their biological functions; such as other than eating and speech. Parafunction may occur during the day or the night, with a common 'tag along' being bruxism, which includes tooth to tooth contact, resulting in enamel loss (attrition).<br/><br/>This pain may be bilateral, it may diffuse into other areas crossing the midline, includes facial pain, swelling and tenderness, its not affected by temperature, and may be associated with the individual being systemically unwell.<br/><br/>This is different from odotongenic pain because pain originates from outside the oral cavity, whereas odontogenic pain originates from inside the oral cavity. Non-odontogenic pain is not affected by temperatures whereas odontogenic pain usually is affected by different temperatures. Odontogenic pain also doesn't diffuse through to other structures and other locations whereas TMD (non-odontogenic pain) may diffuse and radiate. TMD pain may also be a result of being systemically unwell, whereas this isn't a defining characteristic of non-odontogenic pain.\n",

(4 marks) with answer: A. this has occurred due to may be hiting/injecting into the facial nerve which has resulted in bell's plasey, because the facial nerve is located near the IAN and since it controls the mucles of facial expression, this has resulted in high plasma concentration in the facial nerve resulting in increased systemic toxicity, causing the nerve not to function normally = unilateral facial paralysis.<br/><br/>The most important consideration would be to firstly notify the patient that this has occurred and let them know it is usually temporary and should wear off as the LA wears off- which is in around 2-3 hours. However, if it has not worn off, to contact their GP immediately. Additionally, another management would be to have the patient wear and eye patch as they're unable to close their eyelids, which may cause dry eye and severe to be problematic.<br/><br/>B. this may impact the onset of LA as there is increased vascularisation in that area: this means that increase blood flow = increased systemic uptake of the LA, which means there would be less bioavailable LA to diffuse and exert its effects and reduced concentration of the LA as well. This results in slower onset of the LA.<br/><br/>Additionally, the swelling also affects the effectiveness of the LA has it causes there to be a greater difference between the physiological pH and the pKa- amount of LA avaliable in its non-ionised form- meaning it ultimately reduces its effectivness.\n",

This is because ibuprofen has anti-inflammatory, analgesic and anti-pyretic effects both in the peripheral and in the CNS. Its mechanism of action in anti-inflammation is that it works to inhibit the effects of COX 1 and COX 2 on arachidonic acid (by reversably binding to COX 1 and COX 2 at differing degrees), which works to inhibit the production of prostaglandins - which are inflammation mediators, and work to increase inflammation, pain and oedema. By taking NSAIDs, production of PGs and prostacyclins are reduced = reduction of inflammation= reduction of pain. Additionally, it reduces the nerves increased sensibility in the nociceptive nerve endings, by inhibiting inflammatory mediators effects on it = decreases an individuals sensation to pain. As such, NSAIDs work to target the cause of inflammation and reduce its effects. Paired with paracetamol, both together have a longer lasting relief to pain, and the most reduced adverse effects compared to other pain reliefs. Paracetamol alone would not be sufficient as an anti-inflammatory as it only works on the CNS nociceptors and has no effect on the peripheral ones. However, it does have reduced GI side effects than an NSAID, as such, they're recommended to be taken together.\n",

Briefly state how. (10 marks) with answer: * buffering capacity: saliva has bicarbonate in its composition that is present in both unstimulated and stimulated saliva- but it is at highest concentration in stimulated saliva. Bicarbonate works to react with the hydrogen ions, which are responsible for the reduction in pH, and products carbon dioxide and water as a result- eliminateing the acid. There is also carbonic anhydrase present, which works to upregulate and enhance the effects of bicarbonate.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* antimicrobial composition: saliva has multiple anti-microbials such as: lactoferrin (binds to ferric iron, which is an essential bacterial nutrition), lysozymes (cleaves the peptidoglycan layer off bacterial cell walls = lysis), peroxidase (turns thiocynite into hypothiocynate- eliminating hydrogen peroxide from oral cavity), IgA (antibodies that promote aggultination of bacteria), histatins (inhibit bacterial metabolic functions and promote wound healing with no scarring), mucins (MG2 specially- promotes bacterial aggregation) = all protective functions against acidogenic bacteria.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* pellicle formation: saliva has many glycoproteins (mucins) that initiate and help with the selective colonisation of the pellicle. It works as a thin, cellular barriar that only allows protective substances across into the enamel and works to inhibit minerals from coming out of the enamel. Additionally, it works as a remineralisation resivor as it works to stablise ions such as calcium, phosphate and fluoride until a concentration gradient is achieved - promoting the diffusion of these ions into the enamel to aid in remineralisation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* salivary proteins: proteins such as statherin and proline rich proteins work to stablise the ions to prevent the spontaneous crystal formation which results in calculus (additionally they also aid the pellicle formation). This is a protective factors as they work to ensure that these minerals are ready to be incorporated for remineralisation, should the enamel need it, if there is dissolution of these minerals in enamel crystals. Thus, helping ensure that these minerals are bioavaliable.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* remineralisation: the calcium and phosphate minerals in saliva also help to ensure that the enamel cystals get reformed if there is any dissolution of minerals.\n",

The progression of demineralisation of enamel can be influenced by which factors? 5 marks with answer: A. Since fluoride is highly electronegative, and fluoride and OH(-) ions have similar molecular size, fluoride gets easily substituated for OH(-). Additionally, topical application of fluoride, the fluoride ion can bind to calcium in the saliva and both can diffuse together through the hydrophilic pellicle layer, and can form fluroapatite crystals. Fluroapatite (FA) crystals are relatively stronger than hydroxyapatite (HA) as the addition of fluoride helps strengthen the crystal lattice, making them more chemically stronger.

(10 Marks) with answer: TMD: is a disorder that affects the Jaw movement and can cause pain and clicking, is associatioed with injury of muscles of mastications and can occure due to paraphanctional habiets, bruxsim, and teeth clinching during sleep or when awake.<br/><br/>TMD differes from odontogennic pain as it affects the muscles of mastications and the TMJ, so the patient feels pain when oppening their mouth like eating. Wherease odontogenic pain can be trigered by stimmulus such as hot or cold drinks.<br/><br/>TMD is more like generalised pain on one or both sides of the face while odontogenic pain can be localised to specific area or tooth.<br/><br/>Odonttogenic pain can be due to infection (abcess formation), brooken tooth or caries, wherese TMD is more likely due to prafunctional habities like nail biteing, bruxism and teeth clinching.<br/><br/>Odontogenic pain arase from teeth and TMD pain arise from muscle movement.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n",

Please respond in the box below. How is this diagnosis defined and how is it different from odontogenic pain? (10 Marks) with answer: This diagnosis has been defined as a non-odontogenic pain condition where the temporomandibular joint does not function normally and is present through visual, audial and patient assessed symptoms. The diagnosis would have been reach during the extra-oral examination phase of the comprehensive oral examination. The patient would feel clicking or crepitus when opening the jaw, closing the jaw and moving the jaw laterally. TMD occurs when the condylar head is displaced from the socket and may bring the jaw forwards, ultimately 'dislocating' the jaw. TMD may present with radiating pain such as headache due to the connection of muscles.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This disorder is different from odontogenic pain because the pain arises from a source other than teeth. Odontogenic pain refers to pain that originates from the teeth such as the pulp, the dentine or the periodontal ligament. On the other hand, non-odontogenic pain refers to pain that originates from sources other than teeth (pulp, dentine and PDL). Since temporomandibular disorder originates from the masseter muscles or muscles involved primary in the temporomandibular region, it is classified as non-odontogenic pain. The innervation differs from odontogenic pain as odontogenic pain arises mostly from superior and inferior alveolar nerves.\n",

(6 Marks)B. Cindy is 5 and needs and extraction of the 54. She has buccal facial swelling.Would this Impact the onset and effectiveness of local anaesthesia at this site. why/why not? (4 marks) with answer: A. Unilteral (one sided) facial paralysis occurs due to LA being injected into the parotoid gland instead of the target area, the pterygomandibular space. This condition is also known as Bell's Palsey. Ultimately, the facial nerve which supplies innervation to the facial region has been affected. This may have been caused due to incorrect positioning of the needle and not locating the pterygomandibular space correctly before injection. Since the parotid gland is located close to the pterygomandibular space, injection of LA into the parotid gland is possible. The most important consideration in managing this is to reassure the patient that the paralysis will go away after a few hours, however, the patient should understand the muscle movement on the right side of the face is restricted/paralysed. Therefore, it is important to place an eyepatch on the right eye to prevent drying out the eye due to paralysis as the eyelids would not function during the facial paralysis. The patient should call the clinic if the facial paralyis does not dissappear after a few hours as there may be damage to nerves. Referral to an oral surgeron may be necessary if this does occur.<br/><br/><br/><br/>B. The presence of buccal facial swelling would impact the onset of the effectiveness of local anaesthesia at this site. Since the procedure is an extraction, buccal infiltration would be required. Buccal facial swelling is usually an indication of inflammation. Inflammation results in a lower pH than the surronding areas. Injecting LA, a weak base, into a more acidic region than the physiological pH results in the LA solution being more ionised than required. LA works as a weak base and the LA solution must have a higher pKa than the surrounding physiological pH but must not be too far off it. For LA to work, the solution must be unionised to diffuse through the cell membrane and ultimately block the sodium channels from firing the action potentials to initiate proper anaesthesia. If the surrounding pH is too low such as in the presence of inflammation or swelliing, the LA becomes more ionised and less will be able to diffuse through the cell membrane. Uncharged particles can only diffuse through the cell membrane without carrier proteins present and thus, less LA diffuses through and thus the anaesthetic effect will not be effectiveness in this case.\n",

Since the patient has no allergies and no relevant medical history that would affect the choice of anaesthetic, the first line of medications as recommended by the Therpeutic Guidelines will be used. Furthermore, since the procedure involved will probably not induce severe pain such as surgery, the following medications were recommended.<br/><br/>Iburprofen 400mg (6-8 hourly) orally, no longer than 5 days without review and Paracetamol 1000mg (4-6 hourly) orally, ( a max of 4g in 24 hours), with the shortest duration possible. These medications are recommended to be taken with food and taken at the same time. Since the patient is an adult, the adult dosages would be prescribed. If the patient was a child, the dosages recommended would change and would be based on the child's weight. Furthermore, this is assuming the patient has adequate weight and is not considered obese.<br/><br/><br/><br/>B. Choice of medications: NSAIDS were chosen because the case requested for pain relief. NSAIDs are the first choice antibiotics for pain relief. Furthermore, since the patient has no contraindications for NSAIDs, NSAIDs were used.<br/><br/>Ibuprofen and Paracetamol: since the patient has no relevant medical history and no contraindication to COX2 inhibitors, using the therapeutic guidelines recommended using Iburpofen and Paracetamol were used. Celecoxib would only be used if the patient had a a preference for specific COX2 inhibitors and if NSAIDS were contraindicated, Paracetamol would only be used without Ibuprofen.

(4 Marks)B. Outline the main treatment goal and preventative advice, providing supporting rationale. (6 Marks) with answer: A. Presumptive diagnosis: peri-implant mucositis = although a clinical description is not present, since there is no bone loss but bleeding around all sites, this may be an indication of peri-implant mucositis. The probing depths of 4mm indicates there is some form of periodontal disease, however, pseudo-pocketing may have occurred. There is no further bone loss, as evident by the same pocket depths after the 12 month evaluation. As a result, this rules out peri-implantitis. Furthermore, there is no presence of an abscess. The pocket depths are all 4mm, however, due to the implant placement, the bone is presented with vertical bone loss in the radiograph. Over a 12 month period, it is evident that there has been not changes to the bone loss. In the radiograph, there is evident radiolucency surrounding the implant or radiopacity, which indicates no pathology has occured. However, a clinical exam should be completed to confirm these findings.<br/><br/><br/><br/>B. The main treatment goal would be maintenance of the peri-implant mucositis. Since the radiographs do not present any pathology and a presumptive diagnosis of peri-implant mucositis, management would be oral hygiene maintenance of the implant tooth, gingival health regeneration. Although the patient is using an electric toothbrush only for plaque control, I would also introduce the use of interdental brushes to clean the interdental space of the implant tooth and the real tooth. Since the pocket depths are quite deep, I would suggest to the patient for regular attendance of professional cleaning of the implant tooth and surrounding teeth. I would tailor the oral hygiene instructions to focus on the area surronding the implant through the use of brushes specific for implants. Furthermore, to address the peri-implant mucositis, use of CHX mouthwash for short term will be benifical to reduce the chances of further progression of disease.\n",

Based solely on the information you have, what is your presumptive diagnosis and supporting rationale? (4 Marks)B. Outline your initial and intermediate management of this patient as an Oral Health Therapist (6 Marks) with answer: A. The swelling and redness near the coronal aspect of the tooth justifies for a presumptive diagnosist of acute pericoronal abscess. Redness and swelling indicates inflammation of the gingiva and the position of the inflammation and possible abscess is coronal to the tooth. Furthermore, in the image, a abscess-like formation is present however this would be confirmed clinically. Assuming that the this is a real 3rd molar, no implant related diseases would be a diagnosis. furthermore, No abscess is present periapically or in the vestibule, where it is only restricted to the coronal portion of the tooth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Another possible diagnosis is nectrotising gingivitis. Although this case is limited to the image, if no abscess was present, this would be a case of necrotising gingivitis. However, radiographs would be taken to determine bone loss and probing depths would be measured. The symptoms experienced by the patient would determine whether if the inflammation was nectrotising gingivitis.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Another possible diagnosis would be necrotising periodontitis, however, this would only be applicable if there was bone loss and pocket formation present. Furthermore, in addition to the radiographs, visual inspection clinically would aid in diagnosis.<br/><br/><br/><br/>B. Initial management would be to address the inflammation. Referral to a dentist would ensure prescription of antibiotics to address the inflammation, with appropriate documentation of medical history tosupport choice of antibiotic. Furthermore, vitality test would be completed to confirm the vitality of the tooth and if there is pulpal involvement. If there is, a referral to an endodontist would be necessary however, the referral would not be done so immediately. TTP test would be completed to determine if there is any periapical involvement. Initial management would be also to deliver adequate oral hygiene instruction to minimise further inflammation. Ultimately, this would be referred to a dentist to address further complications beyond the scope of an OHT.

      "Processing Question 26: There is one part to this question. Please respond in the box below.Which components of saliva contribute to its protective functions within the oral cavity? Briefly state how. (10 marks) with answer: Saliva is composed of many proteins and has many functions in the oral cavity. Saliva is able to act as a protective factor through its function as a buffer. When there is an acid attack inside the oral cavity such as eating or drinking foods, the oral cavity pH decreases from around 7 to lower than pH of 5.5, which can be demonstrated on a Stephen's curve. pH of 5.5 is the critical pH of enamel. An acidic environment lower than this pH would result in a more favourable balance towards demineralisation. As a result, saliva acts as a buffer, where the bicarbonates in the saliva counteract the acidic nature of the oral cavity.<br/><br/>Another function is lubrication. Saliva contains a large component of water. As a result, the lubrication of saliva protect the tooth structure from bacteramia and other harmful microbes which contribute to demineralisation. Lubrication aids in other functions such as sleep, protection of structures and taste.<br/><br/>Saliva further protects the oral cavity through the presence of serous and mucins texture. Saliva can be stimulated or unstimulated. Unstimulated saliva occurs when there is no activity occuring such as sleeping and is mainly produced by the submanibular gland. Stimulated saliva occurs when there is masticatory action such as chewing, and the parotid gland produces most of the stimulated saliva. Stimulated saliva is more watery and runny, aiding in the lubricating factors and protective factors from demineralisation. Unstimulated is more thick and viscous due to the presence of mucins and is protective by providing lubrication when no actions occurs such as during sleep. Providing lubrication further acts as a barrier from bacteria from attaching to the pellicle on the tooth surface by creating a biofilm.<br/><br/>Saliva contains many proteins, however, examples of proteins found in saliva are lysozomes, lactoferrin, prolin-rich proteins, mucins, statherin. These proteins have many functions, however the main function is to inhibit demineralisation and promote remineralisation. In particular, mucins aid in agglugtination of bacteria. Lacterferrin is involved in the chelation of iron to inhibit demineralisation. Saliva can be formed via the sympathetic system (acetylcholine) or the parasympathetic system (noradrenline). Sympathetic nervous sytem produces the more watery saliva and the parasympathetic nervous system produces the more protein-rich thick saliva.<br/><br/>When CPP-ACP is present in the oral cavity, saliva plays a role in this too. Saliva, when interacting with ACP inhibits the precipitation of calculus formed.<br/><br/>Saliva further has a digestive enzyme called amylase that breaks down the sugars in carbohydrates and forms bollous material to aid in digestion. Saliva is able to break down food sources to aid in digestion and break down food parts to collate nutrients and nutritional material.<br/><br/>Saliva further acts as a protective mechanism from intrinsic acids such as vomiting or GORD. When the body begins its process of regergitation, the saliva glands start producing a mass amoutn of saliva to provide a barrier in the oral cavity from the acidic nature of regergitation.\n",

      "Processing Question 27: You are providing your patient with oral hygiene instructions and encourage the use of a fluoridated toothpaste twice daily. They want to know why they need to use a fluoride paste and you tell them the addition of fluoride can make the tooth mineral stronger.There are two parts to this question. Please respond in the box below and label each A and B.A. When thinking about fluorapatite formation, how does fluoride become incorporated into the hydroxyapatite crystal and why is fluorapatite stronger and more resistant to acid attack? 5 marksB. The progression of demineralisation of enamel can be influenced by which factors? 5 marks with answer: A. When HA appatite crystals react with acid such as lactic acid, the HA crystals dissociate into its ionic forms and H+ ions are preent. The free H+ ions are incorporated into the apatite crystals. When F- is present in the oral cavity, the F- ions replaces the OH- ions in the HA to form FA. the FA crystals are much stronger and are more resilient to acidic attacks due to a lower critical pH. This is also due to the high electronegativity of fluoride compared to hydroxide. FA is more stronger as the bonding is much more stronger compared to HA. The crystalline structure of FA is more organised compared to HA due to the strong bonding process of hydrogen bonding.<br/><br/>B. Demineralisation of enamel can be caused by many factors.<br/><br/>Intrinsic acids such as vomitting or reflux - although saliva is present due to its natural protective mechanism, reflux may initiate the presence of saliva.<br/><br/>Extrinsic acids such as beverages and citrus fruits - Literature has shown that acidic beverages such as cola, pepsi, and lemon juice have high pH. furthermore, the beverages have high titratable ability - the ability of beverages to stay at a low pH for a long period of time - increase the progression of demineralisation. Prolonged use of these foods and drinks increases progression of demineralisation.<br/><br/>Bacterial acids - acids produced by bacteria interact with the enamel surface if the enamel surface is exposed. This begins the caries process of the tooth, through development of white spot lesions.<br/><br/>Chelating factors = Enamel demineralisation is further enhances through the presence of chelation. When the calcium ions bind to a metal ion, the chelating process disrupts the normal HA crystal structure, resulting in demineralisation. chelating factors may include beverages or foods.<br/><br/>Mechnical actions after acid attack - attrition or abrasion further enhances demineralisation mechanically. Although the chemical components would be through bacterial acids or non-bacterial acids, the surface of the tooth after these attacks would be more prone to structural changes. As a result, attrition or abrasion would further distort the tooth structure, exposing the enamel structure of the tooth and may possibility further expose dentine.\n",

(4 marks) with answer: A) unilateral facial paralysis, i.e. bells palsy will have occured because during the administration of the LA, the needle was inserted too far posteriorally and deep, meaning that the LA was administered to the parotid gland, which means that the LA will diffuse into the facial muscles and cause facial paralysis. The most important consideration in managing this is to keep the patients' affected eye moist. Means by which to attain this is to apply eye drops frequently and or to give the patient an eye patch. Do also inform the patient of why it occured, that it is temporary (how long will it last) and not to be of concern.<br/><br/><br/><br/>B) yes facial swelling would impact the onset and effectiveness of LA at the site. Because the facial swelling means that the tissues will have a decreased pH. When the tissues have a decreased pH, it causes LA, which is a weak base to be more ionised. When LA is ionised it has a decreased capacity to be absorbed through the cell membrane.<br/><br/>Furthermore, swollen/ inflammed tissues tend to have more blood circulation and therefore more of the administered LA will be transported away from the intended tissues.

The progression of demineralisation of enamel can be influenced by which factors? 5 marks with answer: A) Fluoride becomes incorporated into the hydroxyapatite crystal by: Firstly the fluoride enters the area, either the subsurface lesion or adhering to the surface of the tooth. Then when hydroxyapatite crystals dissolve the fluoride which is highly reactive and supersaturated in comparison to the hydroxide, quickly binds to the calcium andphosphate ions and then forms fluorapitate replacing the hydroxyapatite, incorporating into the hydroxyapatite crystal which it is attracted to. Fluorapatite is stronger and more resistent to acid attack because fluoride is very reactive and therefore forms a more stable (harder to break the bond) apatite which is more resistant to acid attack and is therefore 'stronger', with a lower critical pH.<br/><br/><br/><br/>B) the factors include:<br/><br/>* plaque stagnation: plaque metabolises fermentable carbohydrates to produce acid that causes demin.<br/><br/>* The location of the lesion: can cause plaque stagnation due to difficulty in plaque control.<br/><br/>* saliva concentration and components: low saliva can reduce the capacity to remineralise or inhibit demin.<br/><br/>* Amount and frequency of fermentable carbohydrates: metabolised by bacteria to produce acid.<br/><br/>* Time: over time, demineralisation can progress.<br/><br/>* presence/ abscence of Fluoride. presence of fluroide promotes remin and inhibits demin, as explained above.\n",
