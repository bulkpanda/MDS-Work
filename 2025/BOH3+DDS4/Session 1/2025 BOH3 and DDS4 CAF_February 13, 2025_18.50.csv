The patient presented with a broken 18 which required a restoration. I was able to conduct my investigations and procedure in a timely manner, but was slowed down due to being new at MDC and taking some time to locate materials needed during the appointment. I was able to independently give the patient a 18B infiltration, remove caries and restore the 18MOB with GIC and a tofflemire band. Accessing the tooth was quite difficult due to the location, however I was able to effectively remove caries and prepare the tooth well. Placing the tofflemire was difficult initially but I was able to place it from the palatal aspect. The restoration went well, however after removal of the tofflemire band there was a slight deficiency on the buccal, which may have been due to the difficult placement of the tofflemire band. I was however, able to place GIC freehand and close the deficiency. The final restoration was smooth and free of deficiencies. Overall, I thought I did well given the circumstances. However, I want to continue to improve on my time management. I had thought I completed the procedure in the allocated time as I was done by 10:30am. However, due to the deficiency I spent an extra 30 minutes placing more GIC and polishing. This will be improved once we are more aware of where everything is in the clinic and waiting times are reduced. I was able to learn quite a bit on how to handle these types of restorations in terms of what works such as the angle of access and placement of a tofflemire matrix. ",Good start to the rotation.

1) Time management needs to improve. Limited work was completed during both appointments. Ideally a full perio chart could have been completed for both patients. 
2) Need to review DTC handbook on protocols so we can manage patients appropriately - in this scenario in relation to dentures
3) Needs to review technique with periodontal charting to ensure we are walking the probe to explore all areas and to review clock positions. 
4) Notes need to be comprehensive and to be specific. For example with 221 notes, mention that only PD were recorded. 
5) Ensure all prev notes are reviewed prior to presenting to understand their full history.

Notes that areas of red/white patches come/go and otherwise has no other symptoms. Dx'd as geographic tongue, Dr. Lara explained to pt and father that it's a benign condition and does not need follow-up

Pt 2 - Pt stated gets ulcers (up to 4 at a time) for less than 7-14 days every few months; has been experiencing this from childhood and stated all the women in her family experience this. Has not noted any particular triggers except for stress. Unsure about folate + vit B12 status. Uses lignocaine solution (dabbed on ulcers) for pain relief. Dr. Lara preliminarily dx'd as RAS minor and ordered blood tests (B12, folate) + fecal test (inflammation) to rule out autoimmune gut disorders. Rx'd the pt Betamethasone dipropionate cream 0.05% as the corticosteroid formulation can help shorten the duration of ulcers.

Pt 3 - pt with cutaneous lichen planus and oral lesions that appear to be consistent with erosive OLP. Is switching systemic medication and taking a short course of prednisolone - Dr. Belebrov predicts that medication may also help with oral symptoms.
-note: Long-term use of corticosteroids can suppress the pituitary-adrenal axis, which can lead to adrenal insufficiency. A dentist may prescribe steroids to prevent adrenal crisis. Stressful dental procedures can trigger adrenal crisis, which can be life-threatening. The dose and timing of the prescription depends on the type of procedure and the patient's health. 

Pt 4 - Oral candida associated denture-related stomatitis where previously, pt had erythema in the palate consistent with fitting surface of the upper partial denture and some erythema on the dorsal surface of the tongue. pt education was given, in addition to lozenge. Pt also noted feeling a sore/burning sensation, usually after brushing.

This reminded me of the importance of thorough questioning and conversation with the patient to help with your diagnosis.

2nd patient - has mucocutaneous lichen planus. Oral lesions most likely oral lichen planus. Highlights how systemic conditions can contribute to oral manifestations. Patient also has desquamative gingivitis. Patient is on many different medications to manage their conditions. This emphasised the importance to know that steroidal medications are to be taken only in short term (affects adrenal glands, HPA axis, and affects the endogenous production of hormones) - to keep an eye out for it as a general dentist

3rd patient - had inflammation and redness due to fungal infection. Patient wore a denture and was also on numerous medications (e.g antidepressants) which can cause xerostomia and thus, most likely contributed to the fungal infection.

When DAing, I need to remember to think ahead and pay attention to the current clinician's needs because during the cons procedure, I forgot that I was needed for suction and retraction as the clinician was not using rubber dam.  Observed clinician remove remains of old restoration and place a new one. No rubber dam was used as pt had missing teeth. Used cotton roll technique. I was able to observe also their manner of communicating with the patient.

Me as clinician 
Next time better communication with patients would be ideal, including less stuttering although this maybe due to being the first day back. I also felt that I did not explain myself as well as I should have and was unsure if the patient understood why we want to remove bacteria from the oral cavity, as I did not see any mention of previous teaching from previous appts. I think brushing up on all aspects is needed (notes, knowledge, materials, clock position, etc.) because while I was able to draw them out, it did not feel natural due to the break. I think my perio probing was overall 7/10 because I found that i was over tilting when measuring interdentally but I was able to recognise that and correct myself. 
I was also a lot slower than I wanted. After thinking, there were several factors.  
- my clock position, I think i was trying to be cautious of the pt's neck and back but I should have utilised them a lot more.
- pt's jaw being unable to stay stable for long periods, perhaps more frequent breaks are needed for this particular patient 
- just being rusty in general. 
Also as a side note, try to keep bracket table clear.  I accidentally sprayed water all over the place when I tried to soak the gauze for wiping the mirror. on top of that, floss got tangled once and I noticed my instruments being horizontal on the tray.  keep clean first.

I was very overwhelmed and nervous, as a result, I doubted myself and my examinations. A lot of the things I had detected initially, I had a second thought and doubted myself then changed my answer- it ended up being the correct identification. 
I was also unorganized and didn't do the base charting on the chart, I had it written in the notes, this caused my pt to stay 30mins behind while I fixed this error; ultimately, I didn't get to see another patient. 
In the future, I will chart in the base chart and set time goals for myself so I do not run behind.

I carried out 2 restorations, calculus removal and a denture insert.

In the first appointment, I carried out a restoration on a 17OP surface whereby the previous restoration had dislodged. The patient was effectively anaesthetised and no further local anaesthetic administration required. Undermined enamel of the cavity was removed using high speed burs and smoothed out with the slow speed bur. The cavity was then restored using cotton roll isolation, enamel selectively etched using phosphoric acid and then restored with primer, bond and then composite. In terms of communication, I did a fairly good job with ensuring patient was comfortable, especially when she had gag reflex and so required many breaks during the appointment. This lead me to take my time with the restoration and lead me to run late and into my next patient's appointment book.

For the second patient, in the treatment plan only caries on the 31M surface was identified however upon scaling and clean there was a second carious lesion identified on the 31D surface. Patient was informed that this was need to be restored at a future appointment before a lower denture can be issued. In terms of the scale and clean, this was effectively carried out and there was no plaque and calculus left. The restoration was also satisfactory, however further polishing of the restoration is required. 

For the last patient, a denture insert was carried out. The patient was satisfied with the insert. This appointment was fairly straightforward. 

In terms of improvement, I would like to carry procedures in a more timely pace. In particular, improve my speed with polishing the gross excess of the restoration. ","excellent communication skills

- Perio review + Prophy: clinician did recession while charting, although it was sometimes confusing and inconvenient to chart as a DA, it potentially saved time since you don't have to go back and forward many times. Perhaps consider this in the future?? It might be more comfortable for patients as well (with not having to repeat the motions as many times) (maybe try it next time). Noticed 2 prophy cup being burned, how to prevent this:  water/ moisture, pressure, not staying on one tooth for too long. Perhaps clinician has been used to using water from slow speed so was not used to relying on water from prophy cup. 
- Exam 2 hrs: That was difficult. Why? pt was unable to hear or understand us much of the time (language and hearing barrier). Put informed consent  in a shifty position.  Pt came in with what we thought was a broken denture but it was their 23 crown (decoronated) and the denture loose because of that. Many teeth were TTP+ due to parafunction and caries. (very much attrition and abfraction present) 23 retained root present. Remember to chart as you go rather than writing it down (the supervisor gave more information than clinician that was applicable for charting but was unable to remember, just make sure you're more switched on, particularly there were unfamiliar terms, however, terms such as retained root tip can go on the chart rather than write in the gennote.) Learnt how to use the xray equipment at Preston. remember to put the tube side sign on the clear side. 
what should I have said in the clinician's place as someone that does not work with dentures and this pt came in to see me? 
- updated medhx --> difficult to communicate..  does that mean we can't proceed? Need diabetes + thyroid issues checked 
- looked at denture + pain hx
- EO, IO exam
- 23 decoronated, is root still present. --> radiograph (PA) needed
- part of pain investigation --> localised? reason? --> TTP+, cold test (wasn't able to do)

Patient communication was done very well today I think, I was very clear with everything and signposted today's appointment. The handover had planned for me to complete a perio chart, OPG review, and Q1&2 debridement. I didn't think I could get through all of it and I told the pt the appointment time may not be enough to complete everything but we will try to complete most of it; the pt agreed and was happy and satisfied by the end of the visit. This feedback was given to me by my supervisor yesterday. 
As a support operator this morning, I was also proactive and communicated with the patient as well for some parts of the appointment about treatment to help my clinician and she found it very helpful; we came to the conclusion that it was great when the other person stepped in, in case we has forgotten anything, it was reassuring knowing the other was there to support. 
Periodontal charting and modified pen grasp; I was very good with my technique in measuring pocket depths and found it easy to angulate certain area's with my modified pen grasp. 
Time management; I set mental goals for myself to get certain parts of the notes done by a specific time, I came earlier to clinic today to navigate the software and get faster and familiar with trouble shooting and base charting, as well as, asking any questions to the DA's if i don't understand something about the software. My pre-made note-taking template is very helpful I am glad that I made one over the holidays. 
X-rays; I was fast and organised as a support operator to organise these and trouble shoot when needed. 

What to work on: 
Ergonomics. After my appointment ended, i felt some soreness on my neck, suggesting poor ergonomics. I think i need to be more mindful of my posture ensuring my spine is straight and I am utilising my knowledge on clock positions. I also mustn't forget that I can tell my pt to move their head when needed so as to not strain my back and neck or wrist. Additionally, some areas (like the 8's) that are hard to see, I want to ask my supervisor to show me how to access those areas and measure PD because I had a hard time and didn't ask. I should be more proactive in my learning and ask for visual demonstrations if needed so I will aim to do this next time.

Next time I will be able to perform the procedures/treatments better and a lot more skilled as I have learnt a lot in this session.
1st Patient of the day. I saw the patient for a GIC restoration. The patient had caries on his 25D and 26M I used SDF to arrest them before using gic to restore the 26M.
I first conducted a vitality test on the pt's teeth before starting just to assess if all the teeth in the area (24-26)
I used endo frost. Since I have never used it before in DTC I was uncertain how to use it on the pt, my supervisor helped me do this and showed both me and my support operator how to use the endo frost spray. This was very educational for me because I have only used CO2 tests before which work very differently from the endofrost.
I have also never completed SDF on a real patient before, the last time I did it on a manikin was early in second year, which made it a new procedure for me, I asked my supervisor beforehand how to do the procedure on the patient beforehand and wrote down simple notes to help guide me. When I was actually doing it I asked for some more guidance on the spot and she watched over me as well when I did this. 
Afterwards I had to place GIC Fuji IX onto the 26M to restore the tooth, I cut up a subgingival tofflemire band to insert between the 25 and 26 to help me with contouring the shape. After applying the GIC and waiting for it to dry (I had placed some on the back of my hand to check) I realised that it had not set properly in the pt's mouth. I removed it all and saw that the pt's gingiva was bleeding slightly. I got worried so I asked my supervisor to assess it and help me with it. She said it was alright to redo the GIC and helped me with it. Afterwards I polished it to smooth out the restoration and excess materials and placed vaseline over it.
From this session I have realised that there are still many things that I do not know how to do. Learning about how to used the endo frost was a really good step into knowing how to use different types of pulp test tools and being able to experience using it hands on was a lot better than learning it off a lecture.
Learning how to apply the SDF was a good learning experience as well because the one that I had used back in Sim class stained the gingiva and everything else black/brown but the clinic one was slightly different to the one we practiced with and stained everything white instead. Since I was the operator and was able to learn and apply the skills and knowledge on the spot it was a very fun and educational experience that will help me in the future as well. I'm very glad my supervisor was able to help and teach me the skills to help me grow","there are still many procedures and materials that you wont have been exposed to yet. It is important to ask your supervisor how to do something if you are not sure so that you can minimise risk to the patient. there are no silly questions, just ask if you are not 100% sure. treating root caries with SDF/GIC allows the maximum amount of tooth structure to be retained, preserves contact points and retains maximum amount of structural strength, as well as reducing risk of pulp exposure and subsequent pulp death.",Lvl 3: Student can be trusted to perform this task with indirect supervision,No,,Michelle Petterson,F_1nTJ0Wpef7QuJ5G,signature.png,6442,image/png

First two pts were 7 years old and were very different, one was pretty compliant and the other not so much. First pt required seps, which I watched cathy do and feel confident i would feel comfortable having a go next time, hopefully on a more compliant pt. 
Second pt I applied SDF to a large cavity on the 65. We chose the option because the patient isnt the most compliant. We did take a PA and saw that there is a band of dentine between the caries and pulp so a SCC could be an option, however we will reassess the SDF next visit and decide from there ","twins seen - unable to see Unity, so very difficult for students to see what was required for each pt

Though they were paediatric patient's, I made an effort to connect with the patient's in a way in which they would stay engaged during the appointment. I also was able to identify caries, hypomineralisation, and erupted/unerupted teeth to a high degree and complete comprehensive exams in a timely and efficient manner. 

I initially struggled with using the snap-a-ray for my first patient as I had not used it before. However, I now understood the way in which the holder needs to be orientated and placed in the patient's mouth.

I major struggle was administering an IAN block on a paediatric patient. The child was reluctant on receiving LA and was moving around and yelling when I was about to administer LA. I needed assistance from my demo on managing this. I learnt the technique my demo used to administer LA by staying calm and identifying the landmark needing to be administered even though the patient was moving. I also observed the communication strategies the demo used to reassure the child throughout the procedure (for ex, asking if feeling pressure vs pain and reassuring that pressure is good). Also understood to reassure the parent as well to help keep them engaged and confident in our abilities. ","Patient 1: Child TA
Good assessment prior to exam of x-rays and clinical notes. It is important to assess previous tx as it can provide a rough hx of what may present. 
When pt attends for TA, always ask questions - what is the problem, where does it hurt, how long, etc. The more information you gather the better the dx and tx provided. Need to be a little quicker for exam of pain - this will take time over the year - when addressing TA try to focus on the pain and rebook for recall exam. It can be difficult when there is a lot going on also.
Good assessment of pain but you always need to check ST!!!! Buccal access missed 74DB - they do not always present like a pimple so you need to be careful.
PAs were good but you were assisted for these - When taking a PA for peads, always ensure the cone is close to the cheek ready to go; you explain the process to the pt; give the pt a time (3-5s count down), once they bite be quick to line up the X-ray to take.  
Good assessment of x-rays + to plan to exo 74 today.
When discussing tx with parents need to be informative but also use language that is child friendly - esp if the child is in the room (even if parents say needles first remind them that we try to use different language in front of the pt). You can also pull the parent aside to discuss tx in full. 
Also good to discuss expectation prior to tx also (what is normal to experience - pressure vs pain etc).
Good ability to identify land marks for LA but unfortunately pt was not compliant for this and moved - it can be a little unsettling when pts move for LA. 
Supervisor completed LA for tx today.
When testing teeth for LA it is really important to break PDL and probe surging because if they are not numb at this stage you want to know if you need more LA. When doing this always communicate w pt and parent - do you feel push, pinch or nothing, etc.
Supervisor completed test and exo as pt was getting very anxious and a little upset also. 
A lot of good learning points from this case today and it will improve with experience. 

Patient 2: Recall exam + rev hypomin 6s
Good overall exam but need to be careful with hypomin 6s. 
Missed caries 16M
Occl assessment was good
Did really well taking BWs, improved since first pt but needed a little guidance
Good interpretation of BWs and discussion w mo
Mo mentioned pt has seen ortho before and they were waiting for the 6s to erupt more. It can be difficult to explained these cases to parents esp if they have a lot of opinions etc. It was good that we reassured her that they are restorable but at the end of the day it is better that they see the ortho again to review and reassess if they are wanting to keep the 6s or extract them. At the end of the day it's the orthos tx plan and also up to the parents what they would like to do also. It is our job to provide all of the tx options.
At the end of the day we can still focus on the preventative care (s/c, F/S, OHI) until we hear back from the ortho. 

Good job overall today, you did well and there was a lot to learn from!!

Thank you again for helping out the team and other colleagues today also! It is really great to have this positive approach not only for your clinical placements but in general.

I also learned about more armamentarium for extractions (Warwick James) that can help for future extractions. I look forward to hopefully completing my first paediatric extraction this year. 

For the second patient, we completed a comprehensive oral examination for another paediatric patient. I learned a lot about hypomineralised teeth and the follow on effects of future treatment (ie. Restoring, potentially extracting). I also learned about dealing with patients that are being overseen by multiple disciplines of dentistry - more specifically orthodontics. Sometimes the best option is to give the patient and their guardians all the relevant information to take to their orthodontist and they can make the final call regarding restoring/extracting teeth.","Really good learning points from today’s patients as you mentioned above.

The children always react positively with this approach. 
Interestingly one of the children patients had a tooth in the architecture that looked odd as it was located awkwardly in the arch. To confirm her suspicions she took an OPG which we then started counting the tooth in each quadrant until in Q2 we realised the erupted tooth was a supernumerary tooth. A Dr had look at it and said since the tooth is helping in functions it is best kept in the arch and and review until the patient is around 6 years old. I really like how everyone works as a team.

Patient 2: 
Today was my first time doing a SSC. I should have revised over SSC as I was struggling to answer the questions of the supervisor. I need to go over the steps of how to place a SSC. I should do this for the other procedures as well. 

I need to be faster at placing and cleaning the SSC because it sets very fast. The supervisor was very nice and helpful. She helped me with the trail fitting and made me realize how the SSC size differs if the separator is there and not there. I thought I picked the right one, however, I missed out that it was not covering the distal buccal cusp. I need to make sure to press the SSC properly during the trail and viewing each side of the tooth. 

I also learnt I should place the SSC from palatal to buccal, this way the excess Fuji would go to the buccal side. I also learnt that before doing anything, I have to first check the radiography to confirm the caries, check clinically if we have the right tooth, check if the separators are still there, remove separator and then do trail fitting. 

In the beginning I thought the caries disappeared but the supervisor explained how radiographically the caries are interproximal. It will only show on the occlusal if it is very severe. Also the separator would be covering the interproximal area. 

Patient 3: 
I had a 4 year old girl. I need to learn to be more fun and not so stiff. I learnt how to interact with children by seeing the supervisor. This was my first time seeing a patient where the patient was in the mums lap. I did x-rays for her and she was pretty complaint. However, I accidently used the same film for both B/W's, causing me to redo the images. 

The other two patients were alright. Last patient just needed to get his ulcerations checked. Supervisor told me to put it in 013 instead of 012. Other than that, overall it was good. ","What a big day today!! You did really well and a lot to take from today!!

In general I think you need to be clearer when communicating to patients about procedures and general expectations. You will develop this skill with time as you develop confidence. 

Patient 1: Child Exam
Good exam overall, please use triplex air to check teeth carefully. You did chart caries 26O initially but there was no caries present. Also check ST carefully too, pt did have mild tongue tie.
Exam took a little too long and could have been a little faster. Understanding I did take time to come in also. Would have been good to try BWs. 

Patient 2: SSC
Great to let me know that you have never completed a SSC before - good to run through procedure and process prior. You did really well to apply this in practice and take in the advice. It was also good to see you try in the different SSC sizes and see how they differ also. 

Tips:
>When removing seps use sickle probe as it is easier to get under sep
>Size SSC with seps and double check size once spes are out too - always look to see if it fits the tooth in all aspects (as you saw today E6 was too small as the DB cusp prominent and needed to upsize. 
>Feel for slight resistance in SSC fit
>USE FUJI PLUS to cement SSC!!!!
>Use finger/thumb to initially seat SSC, wipe excess w CR and then use new CR to get pt to bite down. 
>Clean excess w CR, floss + probe. Then was w water + wipe w gauze. 

Patient 3: Child Exam
This was a little tricky, she was so energetic and a little uncooperative at times. Really good to get the child to sit on mo lap for visit. When doing this you can still lay the chair back so you can see better for the exam also. 
With patients like this you need to be firm and nicely direct or they will not listen. As you saw today she was running around etc. 
You did well to get some BWs from her but BE REALLY CAREFUL TO KNOW WHICH XRAY HAS BEEN EXPOSED!!!!!! You did double take on the same film. Put the film on a separate side so you can differentiate which is unexposed etc. 
This is also a good lesson to see why we take BWs - caries!! Even in young ones, don't be surprised but this. 
Good assessment and tx plan

Patient 4: Review appt post debridement/ulcers
This was nice and easy but also good to see moderate subging calc. Good assessment of ulcerations and review. Always take these opportunities to go over OHI and review hyg!!

Difficult to engage tooth with cowhorn forceps as the distal root was broken down; instead used root forceps (thinner purchase point) to extract mesial root first then distal root. 
Good extraction / luxation of both roots
First time using Gelfoam; one sponge for each socket, pack it down (condenses with blood contact), no suture needed, no additional post op instructions needed.

Anaesthesia with buccal + lingual infil with lignocaine was sufficient; no IANB needed for obturation
Tooth had already been instrumented by another clinician but hand file & MAF was not going down to length; had to re-instrument with rotary file to length. Later found out that there is a likely ledge in ML canal; may have been created by myself or by previous clinician. 
If the ledge was created by myself, Should have re-checked WL with EAL prior to going in with rotary file, especially because the instrumentation was not done by myself.

3rd(last) patient of the day was an emergency pt. They came in as they had pain in Q4. From the previous radiographs taken early 2024, the tooth looked like it had a large NCL. Because of this, my partner (DDS student) decided to examine them first to see how sever it was. I assisted her at the start of the appointment with cold tests, radiographs (PA), percussion and palpation tests. After we deemed the tooth to still be vital (reversible pulpitis, normal apical tissues) the both of us presented the tx options to the patient and her husband (pt said her english was not so good so we spoke to both of them to gain consent). They gave consent for the tooth to be restored and they understood that they tooth may still be in pain after and may require a future RCT.
I did the restoration for the patient. I did not perform LA on the patient (block) because both my partner and I thought that since it was an occlusal restoration without any prepping LA would not be required. However because the patient is in pain and the tooth is sensitive LA was needed. Since we had already placed the Dental Dam on the pt, I went to remove the dam and punch holes in the new one. Whilst I was doing that my partner performed the LA for me on the pt to save time.
We were also running late for time because it took us really long to place the rubber dam on the patient (x2) and the difficulty of placing the tofflemire matrix due to the pt's lack of tooth structure on her lingual surface and the extremely tight contact spaces between her teeth. I asked my supervisor in the end to help us with the tofflemire matrix placement (she shaved down the patient's 46M and 46D to allow the tofflemire in) and after that was able to restore and polish the patient's 46.
I think in the future, if both my partner and I are struggling to place something on the pts we should just go straight to our supervisors for help as it can reduce wasted time and we can also learn more skills by watching their techniques too.
I gave minimising risk a no because of my knowledge. I should have realised that a sensitive tooth/tooth in pain would require LA, especially if their pulp is almost exposed however, I did not realised it until my supervisor mentioned it. In the future I hope that I will think about the situation a bit more before proceeding with the treatments (even as a support operator).","A tooth that is sensitive to H&C and eating, will be very sensitive if etch is applied to is, so it will need LA before you can do anything to it.

I wished I got through the periodontal chart quicker but it was faster and better than yesterday. Also tried recording recession while charting PDs. It was convenient as a clinician and for the patient ('last tooth' is actually the last tooth and we don't have to go back to it) but also messed up my normal rhythm.

Second pt - Restoration for 33B due to non carious tooth loss. LA needed for retraction cord.
XXXXXXXXIMPORTANTXXXXXX
REMEMBER TO BE STABLE BEFORE GIVING LA - either stand or sit and chose before you start. It's dangerous for pt and you. otherwise. Landmark was okay and the pt became numb really quickly.  
Retraction cord: Used size 00. We tried a larger size but it didn't fit. You need to use a lot more pressure (that is what the LA is for) to ensure that you cant see the retraction cord so it doesn't get stuck when using the bur or composite. Retraction cord was soaked in hemodent. 
Remember to keep site clear after roughening up the surface to not recontaminate it again. 
Midway, as the pt had been open for a bit, she was uncomfortable in her jaw. Asked fellow support operator to take over for me as they were more competent and to get it done as quickly possible for pt comfort as I had spent a long time on this appointment already and going overtime. Observed and assisted them for the rest of the appointment. Placed composite FROM MIDDLE (TRUE BUCCAL) TO MESIAL AND DISTAL for better control of material. Quite a bit of subgingival so make sure that the retraction cord is all the way down and use the flat plastic to follow the contour of the tooth. Used flamme bur to reduce overhangs sub gingivally.

Prior to starting, he ensured the scalers were sharp which I feel is a step that I often don’t check with. This was a good reminder to do so more often myself. The student was very thorough with their hand scaling techniques- using the suitable scalers for each surface of the tooth. He was precise, and took his time to debride. I was able to hear the contact with the calculus as well and his slow deliberate movements as he scales. Watching his work was very motivating for myself to be precise as him. OHI is provided as the opportunity arises instead of waiting for the end of the appointment to do so. This is a good approach as you have the chance to explain to the patient what is happening, what we found while debriding and what the patient can now do. Further, the student has a good rapport with the patient as he constantly checks in with him, and provides words of encouragement. The patient is visibly happy by this and is clearly motivated to take care of his teeth more. Watching how he develops this relationship with his patient was very inspiring to practice this more. 
Additionally, the demonstrator picked up a leathery carious lesion on the 43. The student was monitoring the tooth to arrest as it was small in size however the demo recommended to restore due to the location of the lesion and also its leathery nature. As it is an abfraction as well, the demo felt the external stress and pressure can cause further damage. She recommended to go with a slow speed to remove the unsupported enamel and restore. 
I also had the opportunity to discuss peri-implantitis case with the student and view their OPG. 
Overall, this was a very educative and motivating session.

Secondly, I had the opportunity to complete a treatment plan with my BOH colleague. This was a great refresher on diagnosis such as ICCMS and the required treatment pathways. ","10 mins late to clinic. Expected arrival is 8.15am.

Learned how to scrub up. Importance of luxating and feeling resistance when doing so - slow controlled movement. Need to make sure you see mobility before trying with forceps. When extracting upper 8s, use the minnesota distal to the 8s to protect the patient from the teeth going into the infratemporal fossa. Positioning yourself is important. You can position the needle of the suture in many different ways to make it more ergonomic (doesn't have to be at a right angle).

2nd patient - 34 extraction. Further emphasis on good luxation and positioning of instruments but also where your body is. Ensure when you use forceps that it grips on well and push it down apically. Slow movements are better than jiggles. You can also hold the tooth buccally for a few seconds to stretch the PDL.

3rd patient - multiple extractions and alveoplasty. Understanding what flaps are used and recommended was highlighted in this case. During alveoplasty ensure that there are no undercuts, especially if the patient will get dentures in the future. Remove any crumbly bone and thin interseptal bone that would not promote healing - mainly for when multiple teeth are extracted and expands over a larger distance (not needed for single tooth, regular extractions). Ensure that you cut to the bone and raise the flap slowly but surely. Continuous suture technique was used. Tie the first part of the suture as regular and then suture through the rest of the flap. For the last knot, use the last loop as the short end of the suture.","1st procedure. Good observation of surgical extractions of retained roots. Luxation of upper 8s. Principles of protecting tissues, spaces - infratemporal fossa and sinus (8s)

3rd procedure. Good observation of quadrant clearance and alveoplasty. Observed raising FTMPF, tissue protection with minneasota retractor, elevation and delivery of roots. Observed angulation of bur for alveolar bone smoothening, and pre denture planning - ensuring no undercuts, smooth surfaces.

The first patient was initially scheduled for an 011 but she came in with pain on her URHS. This was an SND patient who had a number of conditions which included schizophrenia, autism, bipolar personality disorder, depression, anxiety, and ADHD. I was able to use what I had learned in our SND classes and approach the appointment in a very calm and understanding manner to ensure the patient felt comfortable. The patient was very compliant and felt comfortable.  I was able to efficiently and quickly conduct my investigations independently which included I/O, percussion, CO2, periodontal, and a PA. As a result, the course of action taken was a restoration on the 16DO. I had about 40 minutes remaining before I was scheduled to see my next patient. I was very quick and efficient in giving the patient LA, placing a rubber dam, preparing the tooth and restoring the tooth in the allocated time. I had gone about five minutes over, but I was proud with my time management. The patient was very happy and thankful after the appointment. Something that I had learned was that in some cases, the pain a patient experiences is not clear cut and can be due to various reasons as the PA only showed a radiolucency (R2/3) on the 16D. When removing the caries, they did not go very deep. I had brought up that I also believe the pain may be due to the patients occlusion as her opposing molar's buccal cusp had fractured off in which my demonstrator also agreed with. I learned that with cases such as this, it is important to continue to monitor the patient's symptoms.",nil,Lvl 3: Student can be trusted to perform this task with indirect supervision,No,,paul keong,F_2yfttvXHMou2UbU,signature.png,9378,image/png

I found time for x-rays a little bit difficult for my third patient as we were running out of time and patient compliance lacked due to hearing issues from the patient. I was able to get all of the 011 completed but still needed the diagnostic tools like BW's so that a treatment plan can be made.

Pt had very limited English skills so I got a support operator who could speak Arabic to the patient as they did not understand me.
Competence and Timeliness I placed as NO because the appointment took a lot longer than the booked time and I required help with the cavity prep and LA injections (IANB).
The patient was booked for a check up however their PC was about the missing restoration food being stuck in their mouth we decided to address it first as it was their concern.
The patient's 37D was where the restoration fell out from with active carious lesions in it and their 38M had an active carious lesion as well causing a cavitation in the mesial surface (but not occlusal), some slight shadowing could be seen occlusally though.
The patient needed to have LA performed on them (IANB and Buccal Long B), I have not had many experiences in 2nd year with an IAN Block so I asked my supervisor to supervise me whilst I performed the anesthesia. However, despite inserting the needle in the correct location, position and my supervisor guiding me I was unable to insert the needle near the ramus of the mandible as the needle kept going into the pt's mucosa without stopping, in the end my supervisor took over and was able to anaesthetise the patient correctly.  I finished off the LA by doing the buccal long block for the patient, who confirmed that they felt numbed up. The supervisor (Joyce) showed me a new technique for doing LA, she bent the needle slightly as it allowed her to gain access to the patient's soft tissues better, this is different from what we were taught, I will use the knowledge from her techniques to help myself in the future.
I started with the cavity prep of the 38 from it's MO surface as I had to gain access to the lesion and was unable to do it from the buccal surface. When I drilled into the tooth, after reaching the open lesion, I was worried that the pulp may have been exposed so I requested my supervisor to help me with it. The patient turned out to be quite complex and the two preps being all the way down to the gingival margin. I was able to finish the prep after my supervisor did the bulk of it. The spoon excavator helped a lot.
I learnt how to do the restoration using RIVA bond which I had never done before this was a new experience that I had.
learnt about intraligamentary injection as my patient was quite resistant to the LA, he required multiple doses and in the end, my supervisor completed an intraligamentary injection which was something that I had not learnt about before. I do not believe I am allow to perform it but it was a good experience to watch someone do it correctly.","Very difficult case, even experienced dentist would struggle. Pt was v diff to numb.

Pt 4: Good job with the bitewings using wingtabs! First time completing LA and restoration on a child with composite resin. The patient was very compliant so it was very easy to chat to her and keep her calm. Tried to explain to patient in children terms eg sleepy juice (LA), shampoo, conditioner, nail file (soflex disk). Should revise cavity preps for distal and mesial aspects as there was still some overhanging enamel when being checked by demo. Prep was done half with removing soft caries with spoon excavator. Was difficult to place tofflemire in a child- got help from support operator. Did a flowable base as I saw some blushing. Overall the restoration could be done better as after removing the matrix, there was some composite that had leaked towards the lingual. Luckily it was polishable and I was able to remove it. Patient was very happy with outcome, so as the mother. Overall did good for my firsts time doing LA and restoration on child. 

Competency: for the first 3 patients, yes, but for final patient since it was more difficult and it was my first time, I felt very overwhelmed so I wasn't able to articulate well in dental terms to the supervisor. The restoration could have also been done better ( I have observed myself doing better in the past) 

Knowledge: for the 4th patient, again this was slightly more difficult as it was diffuclt to decide whether to do comp resin or not?

First patient I saw today was an extraction of the 33. The tooth was heavily restored and had caries. As there was no periapical radiograph taken for the patient, a periapical radiograph was taken to assess the root morphology. The tooth was also tender to percussion and had been causing the patient pain. During the appointment, I explained to the patient about the extraction risks and post operative instructions was given to the patient. Profound LA was achieved. Minimal luxation was carried out as the tooth demonstrated grade 2 mobility. During the extraction the coronal fragment broke off when grasped with the lower uni's forceps. The lower uni forceps used were hard to grip the lingual aspect of the root, hence the lower root forceps was used. Using the forceps on the tooth took time, this involved buccal and lingual movements with rotational motion. Eventually the root came out in one piece. In terms of what I could do next time, I would like to use the elevator more to luxate the tooth and have multiple forceps ready for extraction of varying sizes. The patient was then given post operative instructions. I also observed the demonstrator adjusting the clasps with the hand piece. 

In terms of the second patient, this appointment involved carrying out an 011. During the 011, the charting was confirmed and the periodontal status of the teeth confirmed for the patient. This appointment was fairly straight forward. ","1st patient:

I did a maxillary SSC. at first I used a mirror to retract cheek and place the SSC with my hand, however, I was scared that I will accidently drop it in her mouth. Because I was using a mirror, it was hurting her a little bit, and I couldn't reach the 65 as well. Therefore, I asked my supervisor to trail fit and saw how he is putting it. He used his hand to retract the cheek, and that's what I did next time when I was actually placing the SCC. I placed the SSC nicely, however, I have to be faster, after pushing the SCC, quickly ask the patient to bite down on cotton roll. The quicker I ask, the quicker I can clean the excess. Overall it went well. I was scared, but supervisor made it fun and easy. A good tip I learnt, was when asking the patient to bite down, tell them to imagine their are biting their brother or sisters finger.

2nd patient in the morning was for an extraction of the 47. The patient had dental anxiety and was very anxious about the tooth removal. Since I had some experience from yesterday's extraction, I was able to help the operator grab the correct materials and instruments better. When the operator was luxating the tooth, the patient kept yelling/groaning in pain and was slowly getting more and more visibly anxious. I helped hold the patient's hands to help her feel a bit more calm and less stressed. I spoke to her and tried to get the pt to think about other things that made her happy instead of the tooth being removed. When waiting for our supervisor to come over and help us remove the tooth, I asked her to tell me something that she was looking forward to, so that she would not think about the pain of the tooth being luxated. I think this did help her as she was able to calm down and relax a bit before the extraction commenced again. I held onto both her hands and tried to say positive and encouraging words to her (you're going great/amazing, breathe through your nose for me, lets wiggle your feet, think about the trip you'll be taking soon etc).
This was my first time watching a permanent molar extraction, it was very interesting to see how DDS students extract teeth compared to how we were taught to extract deciduous teeth. The only used the wide straight elevator to luxate the tooth and then the lower hawk. I was taught to use more than 1 type of elevator for luxating the tooth. This was something new that I had learnt. I will not use the DDS technique as that was not taught to me, but it was a good experience to see how they did the extraction.",interesting client - good to practice techniques on calming anxious pt,iola chan,F_3MzEkSaloUuC4q2,signature.png,10094,image/png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

    - Read the chart off Titanium but didn't identify fillings were lost or unsatisfactory with new carious lesions present 
3. Discussed needing to be able to identify which is within scope and not within scope to help with treatment planning. 
4. During clinical exam, advised student to begin thinking about next steps/if any special investigations are needed. For example 21B subgingival caries - outside scope - likely needs referral to DDS - what other special investigations are needed?

Pt 2:  Pt was unaware of the appt time so it would have been beneficial to let the pt know that she would be here until 1pm at the start. While there were 2 options for the 27 - extraction and temporary filling we initially thought that placing a temporary restoration on the 27 would be beneficial until the tooth can be extracted prior to prolia injection.

Giving OHI tailored to pts with wire retainers: superfloss and IDB or water flosser has been useful to recommend. Stressing the importance of flossing to these pts has been eye opening to see how pts don't know of various other options to clean the gingiva or subtitute commercial string floss.

Pt initially wanted to do 23D restoration, however, we were due for 32D. I asked the reason for it and they said they wanted a ""plate"" for their maxillary due to a missing front tooth and believed they could be put on the list if we do the work for the upper teeth. I clarified to them they need to finish their COC before being put on the denture waiting list and that if they really wanted me to, I could, as it needed to be restored anyway. They understood and agreed to the 32D. I felt my explanation was solid and confident. Reassured pt that we just need to tick off all these restorations one by one but it will be completed for a denture because I was aware that they were self conscious of their missing tooth (stated by them). Pt seemed reassured and agreed.

La given (buccal infil) 
This time, I ensured that I was in the correct position and height to give LA to the pt and bevel. I also remembered to mention that the pt will feel a pinch. They were quite used to LA so no troubles. Remembered to aim for the root tip and tried to massage the area after giving it. DDS said not to feel scared to give more LA because its better that they feel numb now and for longer rather than not give them enough and have them lose their  trust in you once they feel pain.
If possible and applicable, access from the lingual to minimise amount of tooth structure lost (kept trying to access it from the incisal edge but the lingual provided more control and visibility). Remember to regularly check for stickiness vs hardness in the caries as ""colour does not mean its bad and we need to get rid of it"" (quote dds student). Selective caries removal done with DEJ cleared!  smoothed out the edges using slow speed and also used slow speed to slightly access the dark lines on the incisal to check for caries and then roughen the incisal for a good seal.
Used composite and flowable with mylar band(first time). remember you can use the strip to build it part bit by bit, we first did the labial (used finger to press and act as a barrier rather than pulling on the strip), then distal, then distal incisal edge, then flowable for the incisor. Remember when using the resto material to pull the material towards the margins of the prep not the other way around because you will slightly pull the material away from the prep leaving cavitations (even micro ones).  
Second time using articulating paper, it was fine. was able to understand when to polish and when to stop (darker the spot, need to polish)
While I used articulating paper, I forgot to ask if the patient to feel the restoration with their tongue and regarding post op sensitivity because they were in a rush to leave so just remember to do that in future appointments. 
overall appt went smoothly. (DDS student taught how to do double ligature after appt)

Explained that this was normal and stressed on the importance of keeping up a good oral hygiene routine to maintain health of permanent dentition.

Patient 2: SCC and removal of SCC
With patient 2, I learnt about the feel like what an accurate sitting SCC should feel like. I was able to practise and place the SCC on the 74. 
This patient was indicated a SCC for 84 as well, though after going through the trial fit and it being an accurate size, the distal gap was too tight and pt was not able to bit down for accurate seating of SCC. Proceeded to remove crown with high speed bur as GIC had already set. The patient was very compliant and it was a good experience to remove the SCC and polish so that occlusion was appropriate. 
I learnt that patient communication is extremely important especially for paeds, as well as when the procedure goes an unexpected way, to make sure that the pt knows what is going on and that everything is explained clearly to pt and parent.

Patient 3 and 4 were just 011's and I think I have improved in the time I take to do an 011 though need to work a little bit more on film placement as it was quite uncomfortable for the patient as the size was a little bit big, so the feedback was to just let it naturally be placed into patients mouth by themselves when closing.

Upon examination and looking at BWs taken last time, we were able to explain to the parent that the tooth will naturally exfoliate. 
Second pt: This pt had seps placed two days ago and required SSC on the 74 and 84. This was a really interesting session for me as i have not yet had the chance to place SSC (hopefully soon!!). The 74 crown went on smoothly with fugi7, a D5 size was chosen. trial fits are super important to ensure the crown can be seated. The 84 was a little difficult as the seps hadnt created a lot of space on the D. Operater did a trial fit but when trying to seat the crown it couldnt be done. The crown wasnt taken off quick enough and so it needed to be removed with the high speed handpiece. This session really developed my knowledge around SSC placement and removal.
Before lunch
We had two pt that were sibilings, both had beautiful clean and disease free teeth. All that was required after the 011 was fluoride varnish. 
After lunch
1st pt: FTA 
2nd pt: We had a 13 month old for this appt. I really enjoyed interacting with the pt and his parent, I love working with this age group as they can be easily entertained, however it is difficult to have a good look in their mouths.

How would you classify an unsatisfactory restoration?

There weren't enough DAs to help with suctioning so this slowed down the restoration this morning. I was unsure that the teeth 12 13 needed restorations as it wasn't clear on the radiographs taken but based on clinical shadowing decided to complete the restoration. The 13 was into the dentine however was inactive, and clinically viewing the 12 whilst the 13 was being restored I could see there was no cavitation hence did not complete the 12 restoration.
The second pt I saw for an 011 after pros tx last year. I'm finding this case difficult due to the referral process at the hospital and not being able to guarantee endo retx due to the guidelines and the pt is worried about losing more teeth and struggling to be able to eat. I think I will book a mentor to have a chat about the case before going ahead with any work.

Afternoon: both sessions were fairly straight forwards, primary impression for first patient. I had to retake the upper as the alginate did not flow forwards hence was cut off at the lip, I think I will try add a little more water to the mix as it was a little too dry, also ensuring to push the posterior firmly before the anterior to allow the material to flow forwards instead of backwards.
The second pt was a recall pt, I didn't pick up on one restoration the demo suggested replacing would be beneficial given the age and deterioration. I think my scale of conservative dentistry may be too conservative that I avoid intervening in old fillings even when replacing may be the best option.","nil issues ",Lvl 4: Student can be trusted to perform this task independently,No,,"alexandra radu ",F_Rf2qwUYn97MCPkZ,signature.png,6781,image/png

I have had very limited exposure to extractions, only completing 2 in DDS3 so I was somewhat uneasy with the 2 I had to complete today. 
The first patients 17 was very difficult to extract, with curved, bulbous roots. I was able to follow the correct technique for the extraction we have been taught, however I restrained myself and was not applying enough force out of caution. Therefore, I required significant assistance from my demonstrator to complete the task. 
The second patient was a 10-year-old child who had to have an 85 extracted. This was interesting as working with children requires a different approach compared to adults and I do find that I am more nervous working on children, particularly in relation to behaviour management. This extraction was different in that the erupting 45 had resorbed much of the 85 however it was still not mobile. This allowed me to practise applying the right amount of force, and I was successfully able to deliver the tooth on my own. 
The third patient was a 14 endo in which I assisted for my clinical partner. This was a great opportunity to observe using new equipment for example the IpexII EAL and a different type of holder for taking PAs

Clean was ok, some residual calculus that was picked up by Dr Mark. Important to have good and stable fulcrum, use your eyes, and have a stronger grip. Otherwise this was a good morning. Good radiographs.

- Needed to revise on the choice of LA, originally chose mepivicaine due to their heart conditions, however their medications did not contraindicate and so I used lignocaine. 

Cavity prep + Restoration: 
First restoration for 4 surfaces and anterior tooth. I think I need to brush up on my cavity prep procedures as I had missed some soft caries that had to be removed by the supervisor. Being super mindful that the cavity was very close to the pulp, I tried to be as minimal as possible, but there was still a lot of caries left that needed to be cleared out. CaOH lining needed to be more minimal, something I will remember from now on. 

Restoration itself was good; polishing could have been faster. Using the RMGIC material, I needed a stable clear strip matrix and was successful, was slightly deficient on the distal wall however was not a concern as this restoration was temporary. 

PA of 47:  was excellent

Communication overall was good however if time allowed, I would have spent more time on OHI and motivational interviewing.

Some key points I will take from today to apply in my own clinical practice as an operator would be to first form a diagnosis and treatment options before jumping to conclusions. Though treatment options met seem clear cut, it is imperative to perform due diligence and conduct special tests such as periodontal screening, percussion, and cold tests to determine pulpal and periapical diagnosis to determine whether the pulp is involved before doing a restoration. It is also crucial to assess perio condition to determine mobility. 

I also assisted with managing special needs patients, particularly with intellectual disability and mental health disorders. Strategies such as speaking in a calm tone, accommodating the patient's needs for comfort, and showing empathy were conducted today and will be applied by myself to give my patient's with special needs the optimal experience. 

Another aspect I learnt was to reassure patient who are going through pain post extraction that it doesn't always mean there is a complication and is part of the normal healing response. To manage patient's with this pain who don't necessarily need treatment, it would be best to discuss pain management options such as stronger formulations of Panadol.",neal was very good support for the main clinician today,Peter kipnis,F_eWB0KfmsFgB9c4x,signature.png,6098,image/png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I accidently took in the wrong patient and did a SC/C on her. Thankfully that patient also needed a SC/C. Next time make sure to double check the ID, and not focus too much on notes making. Today I did both Block and infiltration. The buccal cheek kept coming forward when doing the block, making me misunderstand where I am supposed to place the injecton. My supervisor pushed the cheek away and demonstarted to place it right underneath the maxillary molar. I did not hit the bone straight away, however two to three tries, I hit it. Supervisor also recommended to change my positioning as my hand was on top of the patients chest. I did three infilterations for Q1 as well. The tooth started ballon up and it was hard for me to push the shrinage as well. Supervisor said this is because I have inserted needle too deep inside for an infilteration. I should only push in 1-2mm. Overall, was good.

2nd patient:
I did full mouth PA's (in total five). I struggled a lot because I am used to doing b/w but not PA's. However, due to this experience, I know that I have to angle the holder and push more back. I have to be a little more rough. This patient also had pain, therefore, I stopped doing 011, and focused on the pain. Did investigations like TP, TPP and probing. Overall went well because the supervior helped alot during X-ray. However, I need to improve alot. Also talk and give instructions to patient when doing x-ray, like tilt head back.

- Today, I had another patient who was difficult to anaesthetize due to inflammation and infection. My demo assured me that my LA techniques were sound but the patient's state was not conducive to profound anaesthesia.
- I tried to build on my learning from the previous day where I maintained a calm composure, continuously reassured the patient, and tried to employ different techniques (e.g., IAN block, infil, interligamentary, coupling Lignocaine and Articaine). Despite the challenging appointment, I felt calmer, less anxious, and more in control of the situation at hand. However, I want to learn how I can better manage the patient's behaviour; based on my demo's advice, the patient was likely experiencing anxiety which made them more aware of the sensations during the appointment. I plan to review relaxation and reassurance techniques tonight and seek out resources relating to medical and dental anxiety. I aim to add more strategies to my toolkit to relieve patient's concerns and anxiety, especially when the appointments are not proceeding as planned.

Time Management 
- I feel as though my time management skills are not at the same level as last year and I am ""rusty"". This is evident in appointments and procedures requiring more time than previously. I believe I can mitigate this by setting up milestones during the course of the appointment to maintain my pace; for example, aiming to complete OHI by 1:15, to give myself 20 minutes for the COE. Moreover, I need to minimize and restructure my small-talk with patients. Small-talk is a useful tool to build rapport and can provide vital info about their lifestyle. However, if I am not controlling the direction of conversation, it can also eat up a significant portion of the appointment time. In response, I allocated 5 minutes to introductory chats with my next patient and aimed to continue conversation as I multi-tasked with setting up with the procedure.

Learnings: 
1. GVH Processes - Became familiar with the GVH clinic. More specifically, I understood the procedures for steri, instrument hold, the admin and DA staff. I also learned the workflow for the documentation of instruments, radiographs, and clinic notes. These will be helpful next week when I have opportunities to assume the operator role 
2. Time Management - The operator I was supporting (Nick Fisher) efficiently managed his time during appointments. For example, he would set 5 minutes for intro, 5 minutes for special investigations, and a certain amount of time for the procedure. This was helpful to observe as I often run late during my appointments because I lose time in small talk and establishing rapport at the beginning of the appointment.

Today one of the main takeaways was to learn how to communicate with a patient with autism to ensure they have an optimal experience which is minimally traumatic. I observed how our supervisor communicated with the patient and asked for permission to perform certain tasks. The operator also explained to the patient what each instrument and dental apparatus is meant to do and how there is. nothing to be anxious about. This helped to reassure the patient. I also observed how the operator spoke with the patient's caregiver to understand what the limits of the patient are and also what sort of things can help to make it a better experience (for example, not wanting to wear sunglasses, not wanting the lights on, only wanting to do certain procedures until the patient gets tired). The observations made from this case will allow me to incorporate this into my own practice and make the dental experience as minimally traumatic as possible to patient's with autism.","Great job with aiding with these patients.

Im not sure what caused the lesion but since she provided the pt with splints i am assuming it can be traumatic as i heard it was related to the patient biting their cheek or tongue?

OFG suspected - did biopsy but only some inflammation  noted. Further testing indicated ACE enzyme present and a scan by GP showed a nodule in lung which indicates possible sarcoidosis. I learned this is a condition where nodules or granulomas can form in different areas of the body. Did elimination diet with pt to rule out allergies and exacerbating factors. Pt presented today with continuous swelling - happens every 3-4 days under eyes and around mouth. Happens in morning and then good in evening. Swelling more frequent when biting hard they explain. Learned that OFG would have cobblestone pattern on buccal so that is something to look for intra-orally. Important to look for impact on their quality of life with swelling conditions like this. I learned the importance of following up with other allied health professionals as these individuals have not heard back from RMH for a follow up on the nodule. Required doctor to call RMH to follow up. Pt had been taking doxycycline but did not help so now prescribing dapsone. I learned dapsone is an antibiotic that can essentially be thought of as an anti-inflammatory and is not a targeted drug. I learned that in this case if the medication is not having any affect, the patient can stop it and can try a different medication such as dapsone. Certain medications require blood work on a 2, 4 and 8 week interval much like this. This type of swelling needs treatment - send to dermatology as they may be seen earlier with them. Recommended to continue to go on diet to see if something sets it off. 

Patient 2 - ulceration on buccal mucosa - biopsy conducted. Blood work indicates increased MCV indicating blood cells enlarging - anaemia? Monitor patient as blood work is good overall with normal folate and B12 levels. Vertically suturing better in some cases so there is no tension when patient opens mouth.

Patient 3 - 3 biopsies - tongue and FoM. Learned technique to suture and how to insert needle. FoM have to be careful with vein - in this case vein present underneath biopsy. Usually do not suture but in this case was required. Patient is a smoker and has multiple risk factors likely resulting in a form of leukolpakia - biopsy to see if there is dysplasia. 

Patient 4: Pt was referred due to pigmentation. Pt takes betel quid 20 mins a day - I learned that some forms are more carcinogenic than others in terms of when its ripe or unripe which was something I had never learned prior. Slaked lime when combined with other substances like betel nut can increase carcinogenic potential. Pt has white and red lesions on lateral LHS of his tongue and LLHS buccal sulcus in the pattern of leukoplakia as it was not sloughable. There was a thick area of a white lesion that appears to be more concerning than others. Orange staining can be present due to the tobacco and the nut. Biopsy conducted to determine what it is. I learned in this case, we can give infiltrations to numb the area. Need to keep some tension in the area for biopsy. Make first incision and then lift up and slowly use scalpel to remove area of lesion. In these cases, Dr. Jimmy likes to place three sutures with the first one being in the middle as thats where most of the bleeding was occurring and then the next two at each side. Learned that sometimes patient can stop betel quid and the lesions can quickly resolve on their own if it is only due to chemical trauma. However, it is important to determine if it is dysplastic in this case as if it is, stopping betel quid wont stop the process.",,Dr. Jimmy Fan,F_1QAvkL8Ubt5CfUf,signature.png,7943,image/png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the first patient, the things that I could work on is the finishing and contouring of the restoration, I left the marginal ridge a bit high and in ""right angle shape"" where it should be round and smooth. However, I managed to rectify it using football bur. I feel that I did well in giving the LA and achieving sufficient anaesthesia for the patient, as well as applying dental dam and V3 matrix independently. I was able to create a good contact between 45D and 46M. 
For the second patient, things that I need to improve are: I should work on applying the forcep to as apical as possible, so that I could focus all of the force onto the apical portion of the root. I was able to complete all procedures without supervision, which is good. Another thing I should work on is to keep the needle as far as possible away from the patient when removing the needle after LA, instead of removing the LA at the clinical table. Things to note: as soon as the patient mentions nocturnal pain/pain killers, I should be thinking about RCT or exo, without the need of doing CO2.

Pts were siblings. Both exams went really well and the pts were compliant. It was my first time doing an exam for a peads pt after smile squad last year, so it was a good refresher and learning experience. From this experience, I definitely need to revise eruption dates as parents will have questions about when what tooth will erupt. This was a good experience to witness root resorption on the radiograph which influence what type of trt we do based on the stage of its eruption.

Pt 3 and 4: 
Saw siblings again. This was the first time I did SSC and i was very nervous about dropping the crown. However, the pt was compliant, and this was done well with my supervisor’s support.

1: Fibroepithelial polyp on the L lateral surface of the tongue; previously undergone excisional biopsy and currently showing healing and no recurrence. Learnt how to identify it (with a photograph) and the importance of assuring the pt.
2. White lesion on FOM: previously biopsied and today presented findings to pt (hyperkeratotic squamous mucosa + candida) with no dysplasia/cancer; however pt is a current smoker of 30+ pack years; reinforced the importance of the link b/w OSCC and smoking; and how lifelong review is required.
3. Post-op OSCC removal on FOM: Private dental clinician detected signs of OSCC early and made an immediate referral; this highlighted the importance of early diagnosis and excision which promotes the best prognosis. Lesion is currently healing well with evidence of scar tissue.
4. White keratotic lesion on L vestibule with signs of dysplasia with complicated med hx (laryngectomy so pt couldn't speak and required wife to assist with communicating): this case highlighted the importance of continual monitoring and minimising trauma to a lesion; evident through the lesion exhibiting marked reductions in size/protrusion once a denture supported implant was implemented, which essentially protected the lesion. 
- 4. Biopsy of L lip opposing 43/42 for persistent/blistering ulcer which are painful and do not heal. The pt also had special needs in that he was not able to physically sit in the operating chair, and therefore the biospy had to be performed whilst he was in his electric mobility aid. This case therefore highlighted the flexibility required to treat patients with special needs, and also reinforced the abnormal nature of ulcers that do not heal within 14 days.

I also feel that I am becoming more independent with taking bitewings using the Kwik Bite (which do not have the ring holder like in DTC) and understand where the collimator should be positioned in relation to the mouth- this was definitely an improvement from last week as sometimes I would take a bitewing showing too much of the maxillary teeth, and vise versa for the mandibular.",Nicole did very well today - its hard to think this is only her 2nd week of placement,Lvl 3: Student can be trusted to perform this task with indirect supervision,No,,Christeen Adams,F_1OGMEPHy2UH9ZgJ,signature.png,11944,image/png

I observed second and third year orthodontic postgraduate students change wires and conduct review appointments. 

Things I learned/observed:
- Sulfate bracket gates used to hold wires in place. This is being used mostly in private practices now as they continue to move away from using bands to hold the wire in place. 
- Wires can be bent to adjust for any misaligned teeth. Red dots can be used to mark and indicate to the clinician where these bends should be located. 
- The three dots present on a wire can help indicate where on the midline it should sit. 
- NiTi wire are more flexible compared to steel wires which is why they are only used when the teeth are in alignment. 
- Make sure to reinforce good oral hygiene routine to prevent caries development. 
- Trim wires at the end to prevent any discomfort for the patient.
- Power chain can be used to close up any gaps and align teeth faster. There are two types closed and open.
- Lots of clinical photos are taken to assess the movement and progression of treatment.
- Herbst appliance can be used to move the mandibular jaw forward. Shims are applied to activate it and help the jaw move by 2mm to promote growth of jaw to align and fix a pts bite. ",,Kamel saeed,F_3Hqb2gEtIsUN112,signature.png,7639,image/png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The morning surgery was a very interesting learning experience. I witnessed two relatively smooth extractions of the maxillary 8s with simple luxation, elevation, and forceps removal. The lower molars had difficult root morphology; splayed and very long roots. Due to the difficulty with anatomy, buccal flaps had to be raised and alveoplasty was performed using a bone drill. The lower molars were sections and individual roots were extracted. Sutures w/ Surgicel were placed on one side of the jaw were hemostasis could not be achieved. Overall, this learning experience helped prepare me to understand the correct positioning and usage of extraction tools for removal of wisdom teeth. Moreover, it helped prepare me with the knowledge needed to identify teeth that will require surgical extraction due to anatomical difficulties.

Surgery 2: SRO 47 w/ ABx prophylaxis

The afternoon surgery was another interesting learning experience. The pt had a previously RCT 47 with caries. The tooth had favorable root morphology and was not close to the IAN nerve. In under 5 minutes the tooth was luxated out and the extraction socket was flushed out and packed with Gel Foam. Sutures were placed to ensure primary closure and hemostasis was achieved relatively quickly. Overall, this learning experience helped reinforce extraction techniques and how to identify when sutures are needed. Patient communication was also displayed in this session as the pt was very talkative and inquisitive about the procedure. ","Desmond came prepared and I hope he was able to learn something from today. Best of luck for the rest of the year.

When reviewing ortho pt, check for
- presence of calculus, overall oral hygiene 
- presence of caries
- teeth movement, are the teeth still in the midline of the face?

Sulfate brackets are used and elastic bands won’t be used on the brackets.
Wires have three dots in the front indicating the position of the midline.
Red dye is used to ensure the position of the wire gets placed onto desired tooth, and wires can be bent if there are teeth that are superior to the other teeth on arch
Steel wires more stiff and therefore cannot be placed into the mouth if teeth are still not aligned. NiTi is more flexible and used before steel.
Power chain (PC) used to speed up closing gaps.

Ortho department takes clinical photos every visit for records.

One of the patient's was non-compliant for an extraction and thus needed to defer treatment. This decision was outlined to the guardian. Various alternative options for treatment, such as nitrous oxide and a visit to the dental hospital were outlined. The risks of not receiving timely treatment were also outlined to the guardian. I learnt that it is important to outline alternatives, as well as risks of no treatment to give the consenting guardian an appreciation of the consequences of alternative treatment/not receiving treatment.

I also observed a desensitizing appointment with a SND patient diagnosed with autism. I saw how the patient was gradually getting comfortable with the various dental instruments/apparatus. The patient was briefed on the sensations they would feel and were then encouraged to experience it to familiarize themselves. I realized the importance of this as I witnessed the patient get increasingly comfortable. This is a technique I would be implementing in my clinical practice to make the experience less traumatic for an SND patient.

I observed a SSC insert in a paediatric patient and gained an appreciation for trying out different sizes before cementing. This is a crucial step as height, interproximal contacts, and occlusion should be assessed to give the best fit and comfort to the patient. I was also given a tip not to take out the ortho bands right away as there is a chance that the teeth drift.

this was my first time doing more than one restoration in one appointment, as well as using the V3 matrix on a patient. up to this point i had thought you only use size 6.5 and 7.5 matrix bands when it’s an extremely tall tooth or subgingival restoration but my demo taught me that they were actually a good size for the procedure i did today because he had lots of recession. she said i made a good decision restoring the tooth in the middle first (not the tooth next to an edentulous area) but my matrix was not applied properly so there was overflow of material and the contact ended up too long, and then when polishing i created a ledge by using the flame too close to the contact. i was able to get floss underneath the contact without fraying but not from the occlusal, so i was not really happy with it and was not sure if it would be okay to leave and check the next time, but my demo helped me to repair the restoration during the appointment so i went over the allotted time. 

until i am more experienced it might be good to finish/polish one tooth before starting the next one. and get the matrix band placement checked. ","misdiagnosis of a necrotic tooth when pt had no symptoms, no ttp or pa pathology.

1) Suturing technique - This is a foundational skills that I have limited experience with. In the mouth, the orientation of the suture site and presence of anatomical structures (e.g., back of the mouth, neighbouring teeth and tissues) can make it difficult to orient myself. In response, I would like to revisit content relating to different suturing techniques. Moreover, I will be practicing different sutures at home with some fruit and a suturing pad. One of the DA's very kindly also shared a suturing practice kit that is kept at GVH for student-use. 

2) Patient communication (smoking) - Teeth extraction is a stressful process and patients who rely on smoking as a coping habit may resort to this to manage. Unfortunately, smoking can also reduce healing outcomes. I did my best to communicate to the patient and helped impress upon them that they must negotiate what is a priority for them, relief right now from stress, or improved healing in the long term.

- note the importance of ""space"" 
when pt bit on articulating paper, there was a bright blue on the rim of where the enamel was (there was exposed dentine on the occlusal (quite like a crater) this meant there was space for restoration.) This was in comparison to 16 where there was ""no space"" and the contact was fairly even on the tooth (as in everything was articulating). This was the first time that I had to restore a tooth without any tooth structure and I was quite lost. 
steps taken: 
1. articulating paper, figure out what the original bite is
2. LA
3. Rubber dam (this was really difficult as the tooth was far back and the pt did not open very wide. Had to result to single tooth isolation) 
4. roughen surface (the occlusal (where the exposed dentine was)) was fairly glossy. Note: why does it become this way? due to erosion and occlusion Note: what are the considerations during restoration. Because of the smooth surface (there is not much surface area) we need to roughen it up enough (not to remove tooth structure but enough that the restoration material will stay) Need to ensure proper moisture control (needed for all restos but this is very very important here) 
5. Etch, primer, bond 
6. Used Flowable for the margins/ rims to eliminated potential  voids around the margins and have a good seal. 
7. Filled with composite material (basically an occlusal resto at that point) but filled it to become relatively flat/ level (tooth anatomy was not important as it could interfere with the current occlusion) DDS put it as ""I don't really pay too much mind to anatomy. It's kind of dictated by the opposing tooth"" 
8. reducing down according to articulating paper. (had dds check over for me as it was my first time reducing without guides from tooth anatomy.), there was a bit of overhang but I did not over fill too much (just on the distal) ",severe generalised erosion/attrition - check occlusion before you start to see how much space you have before you start placing the restoration.

Also, I focus more on calculus, therefore sometimes I leave out plaque. I need to make sure to check for plaque as well.

Patient presented with a tooth that had a mesiolingual cusp fracture. Tooth was heavily restored, however pulp was vital and responding normally. Hence elected to repair the restoration with resin composite. Was difficult placing the tofflemire matrix, upon reflection I would have cleared the contact point, instead of spending more time fidgeting with the matrix.

- Second appointment was straightforward, carried out scale and clean of patient's remaining dentition
- Gave limited oral hygiene instructions ","1st: Emergency
- 36 MOL - CR repair/restoration
- very good assessment and diagnosing
- Little prompts on PA taking
- Challenging matrix band placement - can appreciate sometimes restorations/Tx may be more challenging than expected. E.g due to positioning of tooth, contact points
- Good final restoration, contact could be tighter, however challenging case.

I was confused if I need to apply more pressure or not because they were caries not calculus. The patient also had a lot of mouth pericings, so I was trying to be careful not to hurt her. Overall, there was only calculus left on the 37D, because there was a gingival flap there, making me scared to go in. However, supervisor told me, that I would always have to go in deep under the gums, even if their bleed, espeically for cases like periocornditis. 

After SC/C, I also did a 24BM resto. The caries for pretty shallow, only into enamel. When doing LA, the tissue started ballooning, so I got scared. The supervisor took over, but it was ballooning for him too. He told me that everyone is different, for this patient, her tissues will start ballooning with LA. He said this may happen due to being either too superfisional or deep in the tissue. He also said to massage the area to reduce the swelling.  Another feedback was to not show the needle to the patient. When bringing the LA to the mouth, I out it all the way up, making it in the patients eye level. I also nearly hit the patiens lips. so be slow and careful. After that, I think I did the cavity preparation good, however, I need to be more confident in my strokes. Instead of doing back and forth, do circular motions strikes. Also for slow speed, press the foot peddle the hardest you can, because if you don't, the slow speed becomes unstable and bumpy. Supervisor said that before using slow speed, make sure to inform pt that this may be ""bumpy."" Same for when placing the strip and wedge in, tell the this may feel a little sore, because the palatal is usually not under LA. Other than that, it was good. ","Asma performed well today, did a simple filling but did it overall to a good standard. Some feedback include;
When giving LA, ensure the needle is out of sight for as long as possible. 
Retraction of the lips - can be done with fingers / mirrors, on top of cotton roll isolation. This improves moisture control in times when rubber dam is not applicable. 
Slow speed - ensure the bur is spinning at a good pace, to avoid 'bumpiness' and loss of control. 
Caries removal simple but done well. Reminder to use tactile as well as visual to assess if caries is removed. 
Good use of soflex disc - will improve with time and hand control.
Overall impressed with patient management, communication and enthusiasm. 

Clean - done well, minor missed plaque in more harder to reach spots. Don't be afraid to go under gingival overgrowth/operculum on distals of lower posteriors. ",Lvl 2: Student can be trusted to perform this task with direct supervision,No,,William He,F_1DYUF3u8aCljWJn,signature.png,8605,image/png

Pt was very reluctant towards exo
Pt 2 - Generalized sensitivity. Investigations revealed it was due to whitening toothpaste. 

During this session, I observed two common communication scenarios. The first patient was reluctant to extract his tooth and it required persuasion and transparency from the Operator (Kevin) to impress the necessity for extraction. The student used visuals aids including a PA, established rapport, and using reassuring/non-pressuring language which gave the patient space to make their own informed decision. There was an added layer of complexity because the patient would be overseas in 3 months time which added a time-limit to the healing time and modification of dentures. 

The second patient was more puzzling because she presented with generalized, severe sensitivity that was disruptive to her day. Kevin was thorough in his clinical assessment as well as when discussing the patient's habits. This allowed him to diagnose that the issue was sensitivity from whitening toothpaste. Dental habits can easily be overlooked during an Emergency appointment. However, by slowing down, the operator was comprehensive and avoided over-treatment or inaccurate diagnosis. 

It was very helpful to learn from an operator with a different communication style than mine and I hope to use some of Kevin's strategies in my own appointments.",DA for the session,Gunvir Bedi,F_3Ja5y9ox8UXxc2l,signature.png,6810,image/png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I hope to improve in time management and in confidence. Specifically placement of composite restoration could be largely improved as I often attempted to fix the seal or anatomy causing me to remove the restoration entirely. Furthermore I think it would be useful to gain confidence in using the highspeed for polishing as it would be more efficient in the long run.

Pt2: In this appointment I required some assistance from my demo to stay on track as they built up the palatal wall of the 11MIBP restoration and also placed down the flowable and packable composite for me AFTER i had already removed the mobile composite fragment. I think my polish was good and the patient was happy with the result. Again highspeed polishing would have made things easier as i used slow speed and went through all the discs for a nice finish ","Moisture control needs improvement, control bleeding before filling and control moisture during placement.

The second patient was an observation (unsure how to input into form as observation without doing another separate form) of an excisional biopsy of a nodular lesion on the lower lip. This was very informative to see the clinical approach and protocol including LA technique of a discrete lesion, suturing and communication with the pathologist.
The third patient was a great exercise in management of a complex patient. The patient was on bisphosphonates and we needed to communicate with his GP to determine the best course of action. I was able to practice analysing the patient as a whole, as the patient was having surgery on his leg in 2 days time, which was also a priority alongside his dental pain. I also learnt how to approach the situation when we are unable to take immediate action. For example, here we prescribed antibiotics to help the patient manage the dental infection as we could remove the source of the infection through extraction, and to allow him to reduce his pain while he has his surgery and heals to then recall him. I was informative to see how dental care is provided within a multi-disciplinary context.

In emergency appointments, diagnosing non-specific pain proved to be slightly challenging, especially when there appeared to be a combination of potential contributing factors. In these cases, remembering to treatment plan from a conservative lens, and leaving the more non-reversible treatments for a later stage post-review can assist in narrowing down the differentials. Additionally, conducting x-rays from different views (e.g. PA and BW) can further assist in areas where there is some doubt. Finally, combining complex history, exam and investigation findings to decide on differentials in these cases was challenging. Reviewing common conditions, including TMD, bruxism, pulpitis and cracked tooth syndrome will assist in prompting questions and investigation choices.

Furthermore, in terms of exos, understanding the amount of force required should assist in future exo cases. Asking a demo in the future to guide the hand to feel for the amount of force will provide a good baseline for this. However, today's exo did run smoothly, but understanding the balance between too much force (resutling in a crack) or too little force (resulting in it taking too long) will assist in future exos.","Kai's has great communication skills; he is thorough with is examination and diagnostic tests.

Originally I was going to be the clinician for the pt, however because they're concerns included loose dentures (denture adjustments) I was not able to do it and passed it onto my partner to take over. The other concern was about a restoration that had fallen out, it was located on the 16 on the root surface. We decided to review the dentures for the appointment as the pt had an open heart surgery but was not sure what it was exactly. We could not to the restoration as it would have involved inserting tofflemire/matrix bands under the gingiva. Since we only did the denture adjustments for the pt I just helped with notes and cleaning up. It was nice to see how DDS adjust dentures for pts.

2nd pt was an emergency pt presenting with pain on upper RHS (15). The tooth was cracked and pulp exposed, the radiograph confirmed the pulp was exposed and infection most like had already entered her tooth, causing her pain. The patient was concerned about students extracting her teeth without direct supervision from our supervisors and did not want to proceed, both my partner and I explained to her everything that would happen in the procedure and also reassured her that the final decision would still be up to her (if she wanted to remove it with students today, or book another day with a registered dentist) . The patient took a while to decide but eventually requested for us to help extract the tooth as she would not be able to tolerate the pain for a few more days. I helped assist for the exo of the patient's tooth. The tooth cracked during the exo but was removed successfully without many complications. I learnt that when luxating the tooth, the PDL can also make snapping/cracking noises when it is separated from the tooth. This is a useful fact for when I do peadiatric exos in the future. The gingiva should also be very easily retracted once it has been successfully luxated.

4th pt of the day was also an emergency, the patient came in with a concern about her 23 hurting. My partner examined this pt and ended up doing 2 restorations for her: 23DP and 24MO. The preps were very close to the pulp so liners were used. I helped assist with writing notes, gathering the materials and helping the operator whenever she needed it.",good helper,aarti jaitlee,F_1mx7UJ3NAyiTqoy,signature.png,9778,image/png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their dentition was quite heavily restored withbridges, crowns (metal- gold, porcelain), amalgam and composite throughout. I saw the patient and did a limited exam on them. TP, TTP and cold test (endofrost) was completed on the pt but the results were all inconclusive. The PA of each area that was taken also did not show any abnormalities or decay so it was very hard to diagnose the pt accurately. Taking the PA was a struggle as the pt had a bad gag reflex and their tongue did not cooperate with us. my supervisor helped with the PA of the 25-27 whilst I did the PA for the 35-37. Learning that applying a bit of salt on the pt's tongue can help was a new fact. I'll try it again in the future if the chance comes.
My supervisor used the light cure as a transillumination tool to see if the pt's 37 had any cracks in it as that was the tooth with the most pain. We found a very minor crack and suspected that they pain may have occured from there, I used the fracfinder to double check the cracks, the pt felt pain upon biting for the mesial buccal and mesial lingual cusps but not on release. Due to the limited results from the tests it was very hard to make a definitive diagnosis. I ended up reducing the pt's mesial cusps to remove the contact in hopes of alleviating her pain. The pt was informed of this and stated that is was alright and would come back if the pain still persisted.
I reduced the cusps with a flame bur and also stone burs. It was my first time using a stone bur so I did not realise that they would heat up super quickly. My partner informed me that when using stone burs I have to constantly move it around quickly. This was a good learning experience.","good attempt at trying to have PAs taken in pt with strong gag reflex. - salt, showing/ let pt feel where film would go , esp by side of tongue , helps.

First pt:
- pt should not be given recalls if they have healthy dentitions and gingiva. Recalls given only if perio or paeds
- Implant scaler was used to remove plaque around implant, as instructed by the supervisor. I've never used the scaler before but it was used according to the ""V to D rule"" and mission successful.

Second pt:
- Stage 1 grade A perio pt came in reporting that she was not aware that she had gums disease. I learned that treatment planning discussion is important rather than just booking pt in for cleans. Shadowing on 35, 36 interproximal but bitewing shows radiolucency only entered enamel. Floss didn't catch and therefore can deduce that there is no cavitation and can be remineralised.

- LA buccal infil for the 27 - although i knew i had to inject into the gingival sulcus, as i was a bit nervous i aimed too high of the gingival sulcus but was corrected during the procedure 
- use needle friendly words like squirt and sleepy juice 
- it was hard to determine when to stop drilling because although my prep felt hard, it didnt look like the right colour of hard dentine - supervisor came and widened the cavity prep which made it very clear that we were into hard and sound dentine - so if unsure, widen the prep to clearly see carious free DEJ
- placement of composite and wave went well
- first time checking for occlusion from a restoration, needed some guidance which where to polish because even though i polished, there was still a persistent high spot in the middle of the occlusal surface - turned out i needed to polish a bit more and polish the opposing tooth that was quite prominent. 
- completed PA using snaparay - went well ","Jennifer need a little correction  when administering LA

Was a trauma rv. This was an interesting experience to learn trauma first hand. I learnt about the conversations to have with the pt, understanding that a guarantee shouldn’t be given about the status of the permanent tooth, advising them to be aware that some defects may appear on them after eruption. I also learnt about being clear in my notes, ensuring to record the conversation we had to avoid any misunderstandings when reading notes in the future. We also took an Maxially occlusal radiograph for the first time today, and was able to observe my supervisor do one. The collimator sat near the nose, and the film had to be placed inside at an angle. I look forward to attempt this on my own with supervision next time.

Pt2: 
Did an exam on the youngest pt I’ve ever seen 3 yrs old. She has no dental issues however, needed gentle reminders to sit still. It was good experience to learn behaviour management for younger children. Also introduced her to prophy today, which was recommended to improve her familiarity at the dentist. 

Pt 3: 
This pt I had a lot of trouble with. There was very heavy calculus and bleeding and although I felt that not a lot of calculus was remaining, a lot was remaining when the supervisor went back through it. Although I’m disappointed by my performance today, it was also a good opportunity to see scaling technique from my supervisor. I learnt to use the lateral side of the EMS and to always make sure to check the distals of the last tooth. Next time, I will employ those tips and attempt to be more vigorous about my calculus detection.  Drying the tooth, using floss, and even using the EMS as an explorer to feel the roughness. 

Pt 4: 
Saw this pt again to do an sc/c however could not due to her monthly injections denosumab. This was a good opportunity to apply theory from the pharmacology unit here. Sc/c was contraindicated and a prophy + OHI was completed instead. ","Patient 1: Trauma rev
Really good to reflect on trauma guidelines and reassess because this is a very common practice, esp in young children. 
When assessing teeth need to look for mobility, TTP, clinical changes, discolouration, intrusion/luxation, etc. Being very clear to document each individual aspect and to which tooth it impacts. Also when documents you need to be clear as to what was discussed w parents or patrons too. 
Sometimes for trauma if many teeth are involved, a max occl is better than a PA as it will show more, esp for smaller mouths. Showed you how to do this today. 
When ever taking an anterior for anything, always lay a pt down to achieve the cone angulation.


Patient 2: 3yo exam
Nice and easy check up
Please review you r occl for decid dentition

Patient 3: Adult s/c
Heavy subging calc and deep ppd. Please always use LA for heavy calc.
LA assisted by supervisor but you did a lot better today with angulation for inflis!!
Only did Q1 today, still heavy subging calc remaining post debridement, supervisor needed to remove. Need to use more visual and tactile clues to remove calc. Use your EMS like a probe, for tactile sensation as your cleaning. Use air and your mirror more to detect calc. 


Patient 4: Adult s/c
Really interesting case due to mhx, good lesion to learn from as to why we always check medical history + meds. If in doubt call GPs or Specialists to confirm. Nice as easy appt at the end of the day but good to do research

However, formulating a reasonable and timely treatment plan could be improved - especially since we are in PC Emergency which means only 1 visit.

The first patient wanted to retain their broken bridge - which required recementation. This was my first time doing this procedure and was quite unsuccessful in having it attached on. There was little tooth structure remaining, thus, a compromised treatment plan as this was a temporary solution that required general care (e.g. fabrication of a new denture). 

The second patient was a 16DO broken filling. Patient complained of cold sensitivity. The 16DO cavity was quite deep with staining. There was difficulty in placing the rubber dam and tofflemire band due to the tight contact - I required aid from the supervising dentist. 

I learned how slight IPR works to help fit the tofflemire band for teeth with very tight contact. In the future, I need to be more organised and ready of what I want to do and have better decision making.

The first patient presented with pain on an endo treated tooth and I was able to conduct tests and investigations to rule out and further infection. I needed assistance with planning treatment when no findings were obvious from the investigations. I was advised that antibiotics could be prescribed to the patient to prevent spread of infection if present.

My second appointment involved a patient needing a comp exam. I was able to complete one with accuracy and detail with added radiographs. The patient claimed to have knowledge of fluoride and flossing which was incorrect. I was able to use my communication skills to educate the patient on the important of fluoride and flossing in a respectable/non-demeaning way. The patient was very chatty and I needed to work on subtly progressing the appointment with out cutting off the patient.

The last patient required assistance from my demonstrator as I needed assistance with realizing the true nature of the cavity. I did not realize how extensive the prep needed to be to remove the caries. Once the prep was complete, I was able to restore the tooth and polish it to a degree which was acceptable. To improve, I can work on my timeliness.","Patient 1: Adult emerg 
This was an interesting case that was a little inconclusive. 
Good primary assessments for this pts
Dentist come in to also review and manage pt as there was no conclusive/evident findings. 

Patient 2: Adult exam
Did really well for exam appt, was a little bit of a tricky pt to manage. If pts talk a lot in future, you can also nicely say that you do have a lot to get through and we can discuss ... after the examination, etc..
Missed resto 37L when charting.
BWs improved a lot, minimal guidance needed. Still needed some assistance when taking PA w snapper - need to align cone with X-ray film (almost need to imagine where the film is sitting and an imaginary line too.
Good tx planning and assessment.

Patient 3: Restorations
You did really well managing this pt and it was good to learn from this experience. 
Firstly we discussed LA (pros/cons w complex medical hx). In general ligno is one of the safest LAs to use, pt did not have any contraindications for LA but good to look into therapeutic guidelines to review again. 
Good job on your IAN block, was a little tricky to identify as pt had a small mouth, minimal teeth and a large tongue. Needed some guidance and assistance with this but did well. Please ensure that the needle tip has been inserted enough into the gum before administering LA - at times you were a little shallow. 
Cavity prep and caries removal took a little too long, need some assistance with this. When you are removing an existing filling, you don't need to shy away, the filling will come out easily on its own and you are not really cutting into much tooth. Once you get that out of the way you can clearly see the what caries remains and how much to remove. Supervisor assisted with removing restoration and caries removal. Think back to basics - remove old resto, clean the walls then remaining caries. 
Needed some assistance and tips with the tofflemire matrix. 
Great resto and finish. 
PLEASE CURE YOUR RESTO AFTER MATRIX BAND IS REMOVED!!!!! 20s LING + BUCC!!!!!! MUST!!!!
>you felt the difference before and after, the tooth felt slightly tacky in the IP areas as it was not completed cured. Need to be really careful with this!!

Overall you did well, it was a very large restoration but you also need to bare the patient in mind too. Give pts breaks (esp w older or really young). Lay pts back slowly, she was a little taken back as it felt like she was going back too fast. Be mindful of this for older clients.

Things learned today: 
* Working with ergo loupes is not easy to get used to them 
* Severe extrinsic staining takes a long period of time to remove. 
* Heavily restored tooth with restoration that has fallen off would probably requires Crown as a replacement since RC restoration successful rate is very low. 
* Prophy helped slightly to remove the staining, however scrubbing the staining with the EMS was the most helpful. 

Things to improve for the future: 
* Always check the occlusion regarding a fallen off restoration before making the decision e.g. this pt has a cross bite which indicate the reason behind her fallen off restoration. 
* Pt presenting with severe staining- ask the pt whether they are taking tetracycline antibiotic as a child, which was evident through this pt.","Good pt rapport.

It involved all 5 surfaces. 
- For the second patient, I did 2 exos, one removing the heavily decayed and broken down 46 (with only lingual wall intact), the other one removing a retained root of 18. 
- For the third patient, I did a five-surface 11 Restoration with RC. 

Things to improve: 
- For the first patient I need to make sure to check all the corners for catches and ledges. 
- For the second patient, I was rattled by the patient jerking in the chair when giving the upper local infiltration. As a result, I was unsafe in handling the LA injection needle. I left the LA with the needle on when getting help by the supervisor, and I left an unattended needle on the clinic table as well. I should reflect on myself and not let myself get rattled by what the patient does, and always focus on clinical safety and minimizing risk, as well as complying with infection control standards. 
-For the third patient, I was holding the clear strip wrongly when restoring the tooth. The clear strip should come out from the buccal aspect so I can support the palatal aspect while curing and achieve adequate contact. I also had a bit of mesial overhang on the 11M, and the incisal edge of 11 was polished a bit excessively so that it is lower than the adjacent central incisor. 


Things I did well:
- For the first patient, I required relatively little help with the cavity preparation and restoration build up (only needed some guidance regarding polishing)
- For the second patient, I independently performed two relatively difficult extractions without supervision, and I was able to safely remove all the root tips in a timely manner. ","LA needles need to be removed upon finishing application of LA

If it doesn't catch, and there isn't any 'sticky' things on it, it is NOT caries. Some dark calculus can also look like caries but it isn't. 

Fissurectomy: basically a class 1 prep and resto to make the fissures look nice so they don't get confused for caries if FS is placed on top to look as if there is a shadow below the FS. 

Patient 1: Make sure to hold button down for longer for xray or it won't show up. Make sure if there are any new findings after debridement eg buccal caries covered by calculus on the gingival margin, tell the supervisor to check, then chart and add to treatment plan. If not, the supervisor cannot confirm if it was really there or not and cannot sign off on those part of the notes.

Patient 2:  Dealt with severe dental anxiety. Need to be more aware of patient's emotions. With loupes, cannot see patient's facial expressions. So, I couldn't see that the patient started crying mid treatment. Luckily, my DA (GVH nurse) was very helpful and told me to stop debriding and let the patient cry. Need to revise use of 4R/4L and other debridement instruments as I haven't had many perio patients so far. In public clinic, perio charts are rarely used- just do the debridement and OHI and recall for more appointments. Perio diagnosis just needs to be ballpark. Can still request for OPG 

Patient 3: Built good rapport. Need to differentiate between abrasion and arrested caries on buccal surfaces- probe to see. First time seeing calculus covering abrased areas. Generally ok overall. Good identification of dentinal hypersensitivity. ","Good job with the cleans and examinations

No PC, was slightly nervous but calmed down after we reassured her that she can tell us to stop at anytime if worried. I was the clinician for her so I did a limited exam to know what her dental condition was like before proceeding with the cavity prep and restoration.
The cavity prep went quite smoothly, I got my supervisor to check near the end of my prep as I wasn't 100% certain that I had removed all the soft caries from the DEJ, my, supervisor confirmed this and I prepped a bit more towards the palatal surface, this was done successfully. I was also worried that I might also need to go deeper into the tooth due to the softness of the dentine/caries but thankfully it was not required.
The restoration went well and the morphology was there. I was able to successfully create a nice contact point using the V3 sectional matrix. One slight issue I had was the contour of the matrix band, when I placed the clamp onto the wedge, the matrix band shifted slightly and was no longer a curve but had a slight edge to it. Thankfully I was able to polish it after the whole restoration and smooth it out. For the future I will need to make sure that the matrix band stays in shape even after the clamp is placed on.

It was very difficult, I was feeling super nervous. I could not get the pt to open her mouth at all. I tried introducing a t.b with mum’s help but pt was still reluctant. So I saw her sibling that was 5yrs old. Pt was very fidgety and easily distracted. But managed to get a f/s on 3 teeth and duraphat application for the 3yr old pt on 1 tooth surface. I also managed to have a look in their younger sibling’s mouth who was 15 months old, he cried but managed to have a look where he had his central and lateral incisors, 1st molars were p/e. Mum was concerned and I reassured her that they will come out in a couple of months. 

My 8yr old pt has eczema and was in a lot of pain due to cracked skin and lips, he was very anxious and was shivering from fear. I reassured him that I will only have a look and there will be no tx. This was difficult to manage.

My last pt was suppose to be a ssc hall technique procedure on the upper d. none of the sizes I tried fit so we reschedule to do a gic filling instead.

Patient 1: involved a more complex history with uncontrolled diabetes who required extraction. This also involved communicating why particular treatment options were being suggested and how we should proceed. As the exos were contraindicated for this appointment I completed 3 other restorations on this patient. This was very challenging to complete within the time allocated and I do need to improve on my efficiency. However, I also believe it was a great experience practising my restorative skills and pushing myself 

Patient 2: This patient involved restoration. The learning I took away from this was locating the caries. The caries was very clearly visible on the radiographs however during the treatment, it was difficult to visualise the caries initially. This helped me practise cautiously but thoroughly locating ""hidden"" caries and especially practising my hand skills. 

Patient 3: This was a very interesting patient experience. The patient presented with a fractured 21, which was grossly carious (ICCMS-C) however she wished to not have it extracted (alongisde a 11 that fractured from undermining caries during treatment). The patient insisted the teeth be restored despite them being unrestorable. Therefore this was an excellent exercise in communicating with the patient and establishing expectations, given that we would be fulfilling her wishes despite our advise and that the restoration would be very likely to fail. This was also a great opportunity to practise complex restorative procedures as I had to build up the entire 11 crown with even subgingival elements 

","1)discussed a case of patient requesting extraction despite having uncontrolled diabetes (HBA1C 22) Letter sent to the GP to manage diabetes prior to extractions.

The first patient's exos were relatively straightforward, however reviewing the amount of force required is still a balancing act.

The second patient's restoration was routine, however when adjacent teeth are missing and there is a lack of reference for the tooth, more attention should be paid to the contour and shape of the tooth. Review of tooth anatomy will assist in this area.

Finally, the final patient had mental health challenges that factored into her presentation and decision making. This required extra consideration during the treatment planning stage that required breaking down treatment into manageable chunks that accounted for her situation. This reminded me of the importance of a flexible treatment plan that allows room for the patient to decide and dictate what treatment and sequence they would prefer. Additionally, understanding the implications and decision making process in the event of a root tip fracture during extraction requires review to grapple with the risks and benefits of deciding whether or not to retrieve it.","Good communication with patients and built rapport well.

I was able to accurately chart all the hard tissue findings and documented all mucosal lesions thoroughly 
I was confident with taking BWs 
I was able to identify all treatment the patient required, which included both restorative and perio treatment. However I realised I need to improve upon the way I present the treatment plan to my demonstrator, especially with complex patients. During this appt I separated the plan into the categories of OHTs scope and dentist scope, however should have presented the plan in order of visits and have the most pressing concerns addressed first followed by other procedures. In the future I will keep this in mind and verbally present my tx plan starting with the most pressing concern and then state whether it is in my scope or not. 
Patient communication was effective. I took the time to explain the risks of the procedures that we were planning and gained informed consent. The patient was appreciative and happy. 
This was my first time polishing a chipped tooth and I was able to successfully remove the sharpness which was the patients concern. 

I need to work on patient positioning when taking an OPG. Proper positioning of the patient is crucial to be able to gain a clear and of diagnostic quality OPG. I can improve upon this by gaining more exposure with positioning patients and seeing how my demonstrators instruct the patient, as this is not something we have learnt during radiology 1st year. 
I need to gain more experience and work upon reading patient's body language, and assessing whether they are fully aware of their med hx and if they are telling the truth. While I asked the right questions, I realised that the patient wasn't fully aware of their med hx (with the help of my demonstrator guiding the conversation with the patient and asking very specific questions). Being able to read subtle patient cues such as rapid talking and restlessness can better help me identify whether I have the correct pt information. This is especially important for when deciding whether the pt requires AB cover. However I believe I can improve upon this with more exposure to a diverse range of patients. 
My time management when conducting appt was good, I was able to complete everything within an hour. However tx planning and doing notes took me longer than it should have - i can improve upon this by taking a systematic approach and having radiographs open when making a problem list, this will also help ensure I do not miss anything. 
Overall this appt was a good learning experience.

Very difficult extraction due to long thin roots, large coronal decay and minimal tooth structure remaining.

At the end, the demonstrator was able to successfully elevate out the D root but was unable to remove the apical portion of the mesial root. Was able to place sutures under demonstrator supervision.

In terms of exos, more experienced gained with the force really helped in finding that balance. On the other hand, operator positioning could be improved given the different quadrants I found myself working in. For instance, Q4 exos are easier to approach from behind the patient, as there is better access, vision and force application compared to attempting it at a 7 o'clock position. At the 7 oclock position, the wrists were bent (resulting in an uncomfortable stretch and less force), and the vision was blocked by the lips and cheeks. Keeping operator positioning in mind and reviewing the best locations will assist in future exos.

For cons, the importance of assessing restorations for restorability was once again impressed. Where there is circumferential enamel, bonding provides a good option provided there is sufficient tooth strucutre. Discussing witht he patient prior to beginning any procedure about the feasibility of treatment options therefore acts as a pragmatic approach, rather than informing them halfway through the procedure that nothing can be done.","Good patient communication.

Difficulty getting profound anaesthesia; some tips for next time:
- When doing IANB, it’s really important to make sure to fully retract and trace your finger along the external oblique ridge and internal oblique ridge, then find the depression in-between, especially in patients with lots of fat tissue around that area where visibility can be obscured
- Intraligamentary injection is a good idea if you’ve done IANB 1-2x, done long buccal, and pt is still not numb
- Since pt was STILL not completely numb, try to loosen as much as possible with luxator prior to forcep delivery
- Forcep motion for lower molar - gradually increasing circles, then buccolingual 
- make sure to luxe into interradicular bone; angle luxator a bit more horizontally
- check if interradicular bone is sharp after tooth removal; if it’s sharp, then snip off the sharp bits using LA forceps 

Patient 2:
- Exo turned surgical; expected coronal fragment to break off given the extend of decay. Was difficult to find purchase point for luxator and forceps, the bone was very dense. Cutting of gingival with scalpel, bone removal around roots and sectioning of roots was required
- Put 1x Gelfoam sponge for the two buccal socket and 1x sponge for the palatal socket 
- 3x simple sutures placed to close up where gingiva was cut with scalpel 
- Antibiotics provided after surgical exo","Communicated well with the clients

It was great to see that their probing depths have improved in the 6M recall today. I think my communication has definitely improved with patients requiring an interpreter as it can often not feel smooth. Really happy with my time management with this appointment as I finished early, making things less stressful as I have more time to prepare for the next patient. For the first time, I saw how interdental brushes can cause traumatic injuries to the interdental papilla when not used properly. This will enable me to detect it better in the future.

This recall mainly had one PC about pain when eating sweets. I am improving my flow of pain hx questions and doing diagnostic tests and provisional diagnosis independently. Next time I hope to explain the patient's PC to my supervisor in a more systemic way. ","Dr Abella's feedback (as came in halfway through the session to replace Dr Carol):
- Practice presentation of patient to supervisor in a logical and systematic manner as it will assist you with later case report writing.

- Learn to guide the appointment, you are the clinician in charge of care.  Set checkpoints and understand the general trajectory for the appt. 
- BPE is not needed for previous Perio Pts 
- ICDAS codes have missed this appointment, you need to tweak the hard tissue examination method.  Start with the posterior teeth and note down all trt done on 011 and then refer back to the odontogram. 
-Need x-rays that are done routinely - BWs 
- Describe crown and restorations accurately 
- Learn to manage peri implantitis ","Rohan was able to identify and self reflect on this appointment. Areas to improve on:
- Time mg, discussed setting time goals
- HT exam, missed caries and often confused during discussion when I was reviewing the patient. Suggested writing information on each tooth rather than just relying on the odontogram as it can get confusing.
- To begin thinking about diagnostics and review when last xrays were taken to help guide his decision making

During debridement, some tooth surfaces were not adequately scaled, as residual calculus was detected with a probe. I learnt that in cases of extensive calculus build-up, removal should sometimes begin sub gingivally to ensure thorough debridement.
Overall, the experience of managing a hesitant patient was a valuable learning opportunity. By gradually building rapport and instilling confidence in the clinician, I was able to improve the patient's comfort and trust in the treatment process.

It would not come off with EMS, it was very hard. I had to go in with scalers. Even after removing most of it with scalers, I tried to go again with EMS, but the remaining calculus will not go away. My supervisor told me to use the sides of the tips and go back and forth. If the calculus still does not come off, then angle it a little bit more. Therefore, from now on, if there is a lot of calculus, I will start off with the interproximal areas, to help loosen up the calculus. There was still some calculus left which I wanted to clean, however, there was not enough time. I will cleaning the rest in the patients next visit.

I am very happy, I think I did very well. I did have to go and do the cavity prep continously, however, in the end I was able to do it perfectly. I also learnt what I should do if there is a previous resto beside the resto I am doing. If it is satisfactory, then leave it, however, if it is not, then remove the filling and combine it with the on you are doing. I was initially going to just do 33D, however, I ended up doing 33DL. The polishing was also fun. When removing the extra composite, I used high speed polishing burs instead of polishing disk as they are more easier and efficient to use. However, I had a little marginal deficiency which I was struggling to polish, so I tried using polishing disk. I was struggling for 5 minutes on how to angle the polishing disk to not hit the soft tissues. The supervisor came and suggested I use the enhancement bur. Thankfully to that, my restoration became perfect. 

The patient was also very happy.

With the first patient, I was able to prepare the cavity but needed some assistance with determining the extent of the cavity. I learnt how to use tactile feedback to check for arrested caries. I also learned a tip of using the refining bur to polish with efficiency and remove overhangs. These are aspects I was able to apply in my appointments later in the day.

For the second patient, the patient requires extensive work due to multiple teeth causing pain with a list of problems. I was able to narrow down the most painful teeth from special tests and extract two teeth with ease.

For the third patient, I challenged myself to complete 2 restorations in one appointment and was able to finish on time. I was happy with this as I used what I learnt in the first appt and applied it.

For the fourth appt, I used the techniques used earlier to improve on my time and completed the appointment early

For the fifth patient, I was able to diagnose which tooth was causing the toothache through the appropriate special investigations. I was then able to restore it in a timely manner which left the patient happy.

- I was able to complete 011 and reason a tx plan for supervisor, the 16 and 26 clinically had ICDAS 2 and the xray shows no caries into the dentine, at this stage i thought it would be okay to put fuji 7 on them because it has the highest fluoride content and promote reminerisation, however since there was slight RL on the 16 and 26 (very slight), the supervisor suggested to put SF on the 26 and 16 FIRST and then put the F/S’s at the next appt so that the caries can be arrested. This was tricky bc we were not sure whether caries had infected the dentine or not despite sound radiographs. 

Pt came back saying she felt pain from the SF interproximal application. Supervisor massgaed her gums with vaseline and removed excess - explained to pt that the gums vould be irritated from the floss or a chemical burn and to call back if pain worsens.

PT2: This pt was older and suffers dementia. This was a sad case for me to see as there was a lot of disease in the mouth. The pt has also lost a lot of due to perio/caries and drifting has occurred which made it difficult to identify which teeth exactly were present, however good practise for my anatomy knowledge. 
PT 3: Took an OPG for this pt and came to the conclusion that FM clearance was required due to the amount of bone loss. Additionally three of their teeth were showing symptoms of symptomatic irreversible pulpits. Referral to DDS for assessment.
PT 4: Took an OPG for this pt and also realised three teeth required extraction due to the retained teeth, additionally low bone levels leading to a hopeless prognosis. This pt was also on blood thinners so we had to give them a letter to the GP to get clearance. 
PT 5: This pt had dental anxiety and by the end she was really happy and requested to see me again. This made me feel really good and like I'd helped my pt which is why I am doing this course. The exam went well, however her 18 was giving her pain that reffered to her sinus. We took an OPG and it seems to be more of a sinus issue, however if it continues we will do a PA. 
PT 6: This pt came in for debridement, however we did not have the cavitron as there were no clean ones. Instead we took an OPG due to the emergeing 8s. We found that three were impacted and so a refferal to RDHM was required. This was really good to practise pt communication as I had to explain the risks of not removing the teeth.

Pt 2: 16DOB fracture - was my first big filling and was very overall very challenging. Pin retention was completed by supervisor. 

What I did well: LA technique was good, buccal infil of 16. Pt communication was good, had to project my voice as pt has a hearing aid. Indirect vision was overall good and improving. Mesio-buccal and palatal wall were good. 

What I could improve on: Placement of tofflemire took a long time, required 3 tofflemires to get the placement correct. Restoration had some deficiencies on the buccal, and distal. Most prominently in the distal as it was overpolished. There was a slight void on the disto-palatal that could be filled with flowable. The overall restoration took awhile and pt was getting tired, and the pt closed their mouth as the bur was in the mouth, that consequently drilled slightly into the filling. Had to get the help of the supervisor towards the end to help with the polishing and to remove the contact between the 17. If I had asked for help with the placement of the tofflemire to begin with, I would be able to have a more successful restoration. Was not my best work overall. 

Pt 3: Debridement + OHI 

What I did well: Pt was referred from dentist to do a clean, completed the clean in a timely manner despite not having a DA - it would have gone faster but had to take breaks due to water. OHI was good and demonstrated with the hand mirror, communication linking between reason and cause. BW technique was good. Stain removal was a bit difficult with prophy, had to go back with EMS. 

What I could improve on: Make sure the patient's dentures are removed before the BWs, had forgotten. Communication regarding tx plan - was a bit ambiguous as it was another clinician's pt, and did not want to say the wrong thing, so I had to double check with supervisor.

- The appointments today involve a great deal of patient communication to support behavioural and lifestyle changes. 
- For example, my first patient had been using Fluoride free toothpaste for 2-3 years and had not visited the dentist for 3-4 years. She also had young toddlers that were given fluoride-free toothpastes. I first built rapport with this patient, tried to better understand her reasoning for this lifestyle choice (i.e., ""I want something more natural"", and identified shared interests (e.g., skin care routine). 
- To begin, I explained the importance of topical fluoride exposure with a metaphor relating to skin care. I suggested that regular exposure to low concentration fluoride can support oral health; similar to how low concentration retinol works best when it is exposed to the skin regularly and for a prolonged period. 
- My patient also justified her use of natural toothpaste by explaining that tap water contained fluoride. In response, I shared that our bodies have limited absorbance of ingested fluoride which is why topical fluoride in toothpastes and in-clinic varnishes is important.  
- Finally, I suggested a compromise for my patient where she alternate with Fluoride and fluoride-free toothpaste. Such as natural toothpaste in the morning and Fluoride-toothpaste in the evening. My patient seemed more receptive to this and suggested she would incoroporate this into her OH. 

Surgical Technique: 
- Dr. Basirah taught me about ""listening to the tooth"". 
- To elaborate, I learned to feel for resistance during luxation and better approximate the path of extraction for a 43 root today. By recognizing resistance on the mesial and identifying the cause (e.g., bone, or ligament attachment), I could use controlled and targeted forces to remove the tooth. I developed a better appreciation for this tactile sensation today and will try to incorporate it during the next extraction appointment. ","good pt communication

The pt had very deep perio pockets and recession. The pt also had a very strong gag reflex, especially if something were to come into contact with their tongue. This made periocharting the 16, 17, 27, 26 very hard as I was not able to get the mirror behind the teeth to see the distals. The same issue occurred for when I was using EMS to debride the calculus off the pt's teeth. I ended up using hand scalers for the distals of those teeth. For the Periochart I ended up tilting my body to see it better and just slightly pushing down the tongue to get the best measurements possible. At the end of the appt I gave the pt some OHI to help with cleaning the distals, suggesting they use IB as it's smaller and might not cause them to gag as much. I think in the future I will try and find some strategies to get around the pt's gag reflex.

4th pt of the day was also an emergency pt. I saw them for the limited oral exam, the pt's concern was about her 22 which was super loose and the 13 which was fairly sensitive to cold. Upon examination, I found that she had several FM erosion, especially on her mandibular teeth. The 22 in question was a tooth that was endo treated and had a composite restoration placed on but the resto was not good and falling off the only reason it did not was because of the endo material that was bonded to the composite tightly. I switched halfway with my DDS partner as we decided to extract the tooth instead.

5th pt of the day was a 4yr old child. They came in with their mum and I did the exam on them. This was my first ever paediatric pt. The pt was very active and not compliant. They were curious about everything so I tried to use the skills taught to me in 2nd year about handling paed pts (tell, show, do, complimenting their clothes, finding a common interest they have, letting them be ""in control"" etc). I showed them all the instruments and made sure that they were not scared of any of it. The pt was happy to hold and touch them but refused to have anything in their mouth aside from the mirror. This made it very hard to do the exam as I was not able to fully examine the child properly. The pt had active lesions on their 51, 61, 62 and because of their inability to comply, we did duraphat on them to help remineralise the caries and hopefully arrest them. Information was told to the mother and we suggested that she used tooth mousse at home to help and to brush the pt's teeth morning and night as they only brushed it at night during bathtime. For the future, I think I will try to be slightly more demanding as the pt was too wild and some control would have helped move the appt forward.
",good perio tx. good pt management - the child was difficult - sometimes we just need to pick our battle - get him back in a few months and hope he's more compliant or consider ref to Paeds to manage.

The pt came in as an emergency to inquire about their dentures. The dentures apparently did not fit right and the upper dentures caused them to gag often their 13 also hurt when the dentures were removed. I helped with translating Mandarin for the operator as the pt's english skills were very poor. I will try to strengthen my mandarin skills in the future because when I was trying to translate the medical history questions, I was unable to do it properly and when the pt told me their condition I did not know how to translate it into english.

3rd pt of the day came in with a Cat 3 emergency visit. It turns out that they just had a rough 23D and a small cavitation on the 12MIP. I was the DA so I just helped with suctioning and notes. In the future I think I will look after the Cat 3 patients as they are usually not as urgent and not in too much pain. Because even if I cannot look after them I can always pass the pt onto someone else.

4th pt I helped with extraction of 22

6th pt of the day came in to get their 26 crown recemented onto their 26 tooth. This was my first time seeing a crown cementation so it was very interesting. I watched my partner cut the bridge off the 26 (sectioned it) as it was originally a 24-26 bridge and then clean it out and recement it. Then we did extractions for the pt (14, 24) as they were just roots left and the pt would be needing dentures in the future. The 24 came out smoothly but the 14 was not successfully extracted. I learnt that once a tooth has been endo treated it will become very brittle and very hard to extract.

It provided a good opportunity to see how different situations required different preps, isolation methods, matrices and materials to use. For instance, where rubber dam isolation was not possible due to caries location and clamp location, cotton roll isolation was the only possible method. Furthermore, the decision making process for whether or not to free-hand or use a matrix was explored further today. For instance, Bu restorations are quite difficult with matrices, whereas freehanding this provides better contours and margins. Conversely, DO restorations are more easily completed with matrices due to easier packing, and the contours are more difficult to achieve free-hand. Using the 'correct' options/techniques for different restorations provide better outcomes and more efficiency in the chair.","Excellent use of RD again. Also good communication with patients.

Shadowed Sharon at paeds observation.

Pt1: 17 (special needs). Learnt some communication methods with paeds patient, especially with special needs (simple phrases, quick procedure, praise, rewards at the end). Helped suction and learnt that speed with cavitron was essential with children (quick but efficient use of instruments). Calculus present on buccal surfaces because of special needs saliva pooling there. Also some on LHS molar buccal due to salivary gland. Special needs patients may become accustomed to general practice with enough exposure to preventive care (debridement etc).

Pt2: 14 (ortho special needs). Transposed 23 and 24. Interesting case. Private ortho opted to keep teeth aligned as not causing trouble and bite blocks were placed to allow teeth with crossbite to move into position unrestricted. Debridement done by Sharon around braces brackets as well. Tufted toothbrush to clean brackets and crowding. Tongue thrust can keep palatal aspect clean so she did not go over it with cavitron. Water floss kmart for $22. Sensory toothbrush covered by NDIS

Pt3: 15 highly carious and fractured tooth. Pt was in extreme pain after accidentally touching it and no longer wanted to proceed with previous plan (FS) resulting in breakdown of compliance. Intraoral photos taken for smile line, max/man, buccal aspects, side profile and front profile. Communication techniques, congratulating hair/course, apologising for moving the tooth left the pt who was visibly distressed less so towards the end of the tx. Will apply in future when confronted with something similar. Don’t panic, maintain composure and speak calmly with the pt.

Pt4 9 yrs. 2 Fissure sealant on 2 teeth. Clingpro used etch bond and cure for 60s. Since tooth was wobbly, pt was not brushing it even though not painful, leading to ulcerative gingivitis around the tooth, thus causing pain. Sharon kept the pt in seat and not worried by reassuring she would not touch the area. Procedure went smoothly and all steps were explained to the pt.","Had many behaviour issues today , some interesting radiograph ",Sharon Richardson,F_273TyLjbRLtlZnG,signature.png,6805,image/png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was quite proud of my time management and how I approached each case. The first patient was 70 years old and had a lone standing 36 that had a DOB fracture and had an unsatisfactory RCT. I was able to collect information and conduct special investigations in a quick and efficient manner to come to a diagnosis and come up with a tx plan. The pt elected for an extraction and I was able to independently give an IAN block, infiltration and an intra-ligamentary injection. I was able to independently luxate and obtain mobility. I noticed that her gingiva around the tooth was very loose and in this case I learned that instead of cownhorns we can still use hawks as the loose gingiva allows us to engage more apically on the tooth for a better grasp. This was very effective as I was able to engage lower on the tooth as the gingiva was not in the way and was able to extract the tooth in one piece. I also learned about haemostatic agents, which I was not quite aware of prior. I learned that alveogyl is often used if a patient comes in with a dehydrated socket whereas surgacell and can be used as a haemostatic agent. I was proud of how I managed my time as I finished before 10:15am which is when my next patient was scheduled. My second patient came in with pain on her LLHS and after conducting investigations, the patient required a redress of her 37. When I went in with handfiles, there was a stop in each canal in which my demo explained is calcification. I learned that we can sometimes see this on radiographs as she showed me we can see where it stops on the PA as well. I learned that sometimes we can use EDTA and RC Prep to soften the dentine and try to negotiate the canals. However, in this case we could not get much further so I redressed with odontopaste and referred to endo. Overall, I was happy with my time management and ability to manage the patients.","Discussion reflected above. Good patient management.

I will keep this in mind and recommend this strategy in the future. The patient who presented with tardive dyskinesia and rolling tongue also complained of nerve sensations throughout the whole body, indicating more of a neurological problem such as Huntington's disease.

They had attempted to place crowns, however they did not fit. I used the high speed handpick until I reached soft dentine, removed the affected dentine with the slow speed and spoon escalator. It was interesting to see the colour change of dentine from affected to normal (this is my first caries removal for the year). I then placed a t-bar matrix and used FUJI 2 for the restoration due to this fugitive having resin particles making it stronger and more durable. I polished it off and the pt was really happy. I also placed seps for the 74 and 84, and we will see next appt how we go getting them on, otherwise another restoration will be done. 

Pt 2: Completed an exam for this pt, took BWs to check inter proximal areas. 6s had hypo min so next visit will apply FS to all 6s. This pt was 6 yrs old and 71 and 81 had not exfoliated, and the 41 was partially erupted. I encourage the parents to gently wobble the tooth to promote exfoliation and will review. If the tooth hasn’t exfoliated within 8 weeks, exo would be required. Jacky also explained how to use my finger to line up the radiograph machine to the film when using wing tab technique, this was really helpful. 

Pt3: Had an 11 year old for an exam. this pt was very nervous and so I used techniques like tell-show-do and also made them feel more comfortable (using gradual exposure) by using the micro-brush instead of the probe as the pt did not like the feeling of the probe. We did get through the exam, with some difficulty as she kept closing her lips over the probe, however I took my time and distracted her by asking questions about school, sport and music which calmed her down. This pt has class 2 div 2 malocclsuion and so needs a referral to RDHM, however oral hygiene is very poor so I spent a lot of time going over this and hopefully next visit their is some improvement.

Patient 1 - EXAM:
> I improved my communication skills and I was much more fun in the appointment as the patient an the parent were both having fun. However, I still need to improve on how to talk when the supervisor comes in, for example, introducing the patient to the supervisor. The patients 51 and 61 had no enamel left. I thought we should maybe put duraphat for sensitivity, but supervisor said to leave it how it is as it is not causing any pain. The pulp was also exposed, so placing duraphat would not be a good idea. I also placed SDF on other non-carious tooth loss teeth. The three non-carious tooth loss teeth also had caries, therefore we placed SDF. We recommended coming after 6 months because the 6's were not out, and we can not place SCC unless they are out. The caries were also very minimal from the radiograph, so we just wait till 6 months. Overall went good. 

I need to increase practice in communication with mums who have a lot of kids. The patient would eat candy alot. When I tried talking to the mum about this, she would say she has a lot of kids, so balacing diet is hard, ""you have got to feed them what you got. "" pt also did not like vegatables. The pt would be eating cereal, toast, orea for lunch, candies for snack. So trying to recommend healthy yet tasty products for children is what I have to improve on. I felt like I was pushing the mum too much. 

patient 2: - EXAM 
This patient had ICCMS B caries on 85. However, they were arrested. I did not know they were arrested. Supervisor said that since their are firm, it is arrested. It may have also had SDF applied on, according to supervisor as it seems black and firm, but she said it is just an assumption. Good communication with this patient as well. 

patient 3: 
This patient had pain on her 46. I did pain history but it was leading to no direction as it was just slight pain which came upon eating and drinking cold food. Therefore, we took an x-ray, did cold test, TTP, TP. No problem in 46 but 48 was no responding to cold test and seemed like there was a radiolucency as well. We were going to do clean but from the x-ray, it seemed like there was bone loss, therefore, we did periodontal chart. The pocketings were 1-3mm (except for 48M being 5mm), however there was recession and some BOP. According to the supervisor, this was a chronic controlled periodontitis. However, I was confused with the stage and Grade, because the CAL was 4mm and mostly 1-3mm pocket depth which makes it more stage 2, but there was vertical bone loss present which makes it grade 3 as well. Supervisor said to ask a OHT supervisor as they would know more. 

pt 4 - SCC on 65
I got confused, thinking 65 is 64, because I kept seeing younger peads who did not have their 6's. So I thought the second last tooth was 64, when it was actually 65. Supervisor corrected me thankfully. Also, when trial fitting, it is important to check if the crown is the right one, because sometimes they can be put in the wrong section. Which is what happened to the supervisor two times in this appt. Therefore, in the future, even if DA hands you the crown, make sure to double check that the crown is right. 

Also, a SCC is painful for some kids. Do not say it is not going to hurt. For some kids it does not hurt, but for  others it does. So instead of telling the patient it doesn't hurt, just say, ""you can going to feel some pressure on the gums and tooth when I press the crown down, but after I clean it up, you will feel much for comfortable."" ","Assistance given with crown selection and placement. More experience needed.

- Unable to achieve profound anaesthesia despite ~8.8 mL of Lignocaine due to ongoing infection which reduced the effectiveness of the anaesthetic. 
- I learned that in these circumstances, it is important to constantly reassure the patient and explain that the lack of anaesthesia is due to ongoing infection. By doing so, I can better manage the patient's expectations and maintain their confidence in my skills. On a technical note, it is helpful to use various techniques to achieve anaesthesia.

- Today, I did not have access to any luxators due to issues with the Steri. As a result, had to rely on cryers and elevators.

I was very careful with the instrumentation, not causing any clinical incidents or any perforation/apical gorging. 
I got to feel the difference in instrumentation in a dry canal versus a slightly irrigated canal.  The sensation is quite different (i.e. in a totally dry canal, the canal binds to the instrument more, so I had to lift up my instrument more). From this experience, I learned to leave a small amount of hypochloride after the irrigation so that the rotary instrument can operate more smoothly. 
Things to work on: I should slightly expand the access a bit so that my file can enter without needing to flex or bend too much, this would help with the rotary instrumentation as it will reduce the strain that the rotary files go through. 

Second patient: 
Did a relatively simple restoration on the 24 with cotton coll isolation. 
Positives: good time management, and able to contour the restoration so that it does not interfere with occlusion or denture plate. 
Things to improve on: Had a bit of deficiency on the palatal side before being pointed out by my student assistant Kruti. Also need to work on the anatomy knowledge, knowing where to place the groove and where the cusp ends. Had a bit of high spot on the lingual wall of the restoration.

Third patient: 
Very challenging patient, had to take out the 17 and 18.
Positives: Managed to exo the 17, 18 mostly unsupervised, even though some elevator action was required. Was careful not to cause OAC and not to leave roots in situ. Did the suturing independently and was able to achieve hemostasis. Gave detailed briefing on potential risks of the exo (ORNJ, OAC, dry socket, bleeding risk, iatrogenic damage to nearby soft and hard tissues)
Things to work on: I need to work on my luxation technique. In the past I only did apical movement with the luxator, but what I should've done is to luxate apically, keeping the tension on the bone, while slowly turning the handle of the luxator to expand the socket. I also need to work on my luxator grip, as I am holding too low on the handle.

For the third patient, I was able to perform an 011 and bitewings in an efficient manner. To improve, I can be better at distinguishing caries from staining by checking with my probe if the lesion is soft or not. I will use this in my future cases to be more definitive in this.

Despite the 16DO restoration being deficient and may be contributing to the persisting periodontal pocket there, the area appeared to be cleansable. Hence, for the time being, it is justifiable to hold off doing the restoration and monitor instead.

for my adult patients, I completed exams. 
patient 1:
during the exam, the had a potentially cracked tooth and was experiencing pain upon pressure being applied. when questioned on the cracked tooth options or the differential diagnoses for a cracked tooth, I was unsure of what the options were apart from having the tooth removed. this indicated a gap in my knowledge as the dentist supervising aided in having that conversation with the pt where they mentioned having an ortho band placed, restoring the tooth, doing nothing and checking the tooth again for high points. 

patient 2:
completed an exam for the patient. during the exam, I noted multiple carious lesions across the entire dentition and saw an abscessed tooth. in explaining the abscess and the next indicated treatment options, I was unsure of how to proceed and required the supervisor to assist in my conversations with the pt. the options for the abscessed tooth were mainly to do nothing or to have it removed. I had originally suggested having it drained but that would not do anything for the tooth as the tooth already is infected and non-vital (ICDAS 6 cavitation on the D). due to the high caries risk and numerous carious lesions, I took a lot longer with my exam and was unable to take the BWs or the PA required to accurately TRTPLAN in the same appt.

patient 3 + 4: 
completed 2 adult exams. 

patient 5:
patient previously had mesiodens. required assistance again from the supervisor in discussing the treatment plan with the patient but was able to propose the appropriate next steps independently. in future, I want to improve on my discussions with both the patients and the parents when discussing treatment options.

patient 6: 
completed a small restoration with Fuji 9 on the 54O. decided against Fuji 2 due to needing a light cure and the patient beginning to get a bit wriggly. required supervisor to check and remove more from the DEJ of the prep but should have known to clear the DEJ myself and recognise it. hopefully for my next restorations, I won't overfill the teeth and will be able to have a cavity preparation that is satisfactory the first try. overall, a good opportunity to practice a more invasive procedure on a paeds pt which I have not done before.","Running a little late with 2nd patient  - complicated exam.

3rd: 37B cons and 071 (impressions). Patient was very chill and compliant. It was a bit hard to do the cavity prep because I was worried that I would need to go too close to the gingival margin. However, I was able to prep to the hard dentine. There is a visible difference between the sound of hard/firm dentine and soft caries when using the sickle probe to run along the area. Restoration done well, no defective margins, all smooth. Accidentally pressed a little too hard on the middle buccal area causing a slight divot but it wasn't on the margin so it was fine. Also used articulating paper to polish down the higher areas. First time doing impressions on patients! First one was a fail (midline was off, and the front did not have enough alginate so you could see the impression plate? Second one was better, I put the impression in and aligned the midline first and pushed the front teeth first before the back teeth. May have pressed too hard because there was some blood at the end. 

4th: patient was very nervous in the chair and had some anxiety. Managed to talk her into having an exo for her 83 which was severely decayed. Exo done with tiny bit of LA and used flat plastic. Was an interesting sensation feeling the tooth disconnect from gingiva and PDL. 
","overall a good learning day. Self reflection if good. needed some guidance with cavity prep-ensuring margin was clean and decay wasn't active, was a hard area to see.

My confidence using the high speed handpiece has also increased which is good, especially for polishing.

What I did well: Pt communication was good, and getting OH history was good. Gathering a holistic view of the pt including their shx to help implement practical advice for pt for their OHI. Debridement technique and patient management was good, required multiple breaks due to gingival sensitivity but ensured pt was in control. Pts were reciprocative to OHI and tx plan which indicated to me that my communication is improving. 


Patient 3: 11DIBP uncomplicated crown fracture 

What I did well: Pt rapport was good to ensure pt was comfortable, pain history, tests and PA were good and continues to improve to gather all the information. 

What I could improve on: LA radiated to the pt eye's and management with that could be improved, instead of saying ""its ok it will wear off in two hours"", I could say ""great it is working"".

Otherwise I think time management is getting slightly better. 4th pt of the day (pt 3 on caf) is why I said No to minimising risk. I did not look through their dental chart as thoroughly as I should have.

(patient 1) 1st pt of the day came in for an emergency appt with their daughter to help translate. They were concerned about the pain in their mouth and the pain affecting their ability to wear their dentures. I saw the pt and did a limited exam on them. There was visible swelling on her 31-34 gingival area and palpation E/O and I/O in that area caused discomfort and pain. TTP tests were positive in that area as well. I did cold tests using endofrost but because the pt had a bridge in that area it was very hard to get a conclusive result. The PA that I took showed apical radiolucencies on the 42 and 31-33 apices. With the help of my supervisor and my DDS partner, we explained to the pt the options that they had which was to get RCT completed to alleviate the pain and potentially resolve the infection which is causing the swelling and pain. However the RCT would be very hard to complete in YCH as the teeth were covered with a porcelain fused metal bridge and one of them (32) also had 2 canals which would have made it a very hard to do RCT. Options such as referral to RDHM Spec Endo, private spec endo were given and also extraction. The pt decided to go and seek private first just to help drain the canals to alleviate some of the pain temporarily as the RDHM waitlist would take too long and they may not even get accepted. In this appt I learnt about the different referral pathways for pt's if the clinic doesn't offer the treatment/procedure.

(patient 2) about a tooth (35) with a missing filling which was causing her pain preventing her from being able to eat. Upon examination the tooth was missing part of the amalgam restoration (DO fell off) and was grade 3 mobility with TTP being +ve. It was decided that the pt needed to extract the tooth as it was a hopeless prognosis. I performed LA on the pt with Lignocaine to numb them up before assisting for the extraction, however the pt still felt a bit of pain along their gingival margin after I did the buccal and lingual infils and checked that anaesthesia had been achieved. SO my partner used articaine to numb them up again as it was a stronger LA, he also performed a PDL infiltration to help directly numb the gingiva. I wasn't taught the PDL numbing technique, but it was a good experience to watch them do it.

(patient 3) 4th pt of the day came in for a debridement. I took over from another student clinician to finish of the debridement (I only debrided the mandibular teeth) and then do FM prophy and duraphat. The pt had a composite bridge on their 42-31 to stablise their 41 which had broken off in the past. I did not realise this properly as I had thought it was just a normal bridge instead of one to stablise broken teeth. Whilst the debridement went smoothly and no issues happened this was something that I need to take note of in the future because if something had happened I would have gauged the bridge and caused a plaque trap, which can cause gingival inflammation under the pontic. Another point from this appt was charting the pt's odontogram. I learnt that even if I was not the original clinician to do the COE on them I still need to make sure that the odontogram is up-to-date and that the things are charted correctly. This makes sense I'm not sure why I did not know about this before, but from now I will make sure that I am aware of the pt's full dental condition before beginning anything and also making sure that everything is charted correctly.
","the first patient was a bit out of scope for a BOH but it is still important to be able to recognise and diagnose dental pathology that is causing the patient significant pain. recognising amalgam tattoos to rule out other pathology - amalgam tattoos are permanent, so even if there is no amalgams nearby now, there may have been in the past, so don't discount as a Dx. If the pt reports feeling pain and some swelling, palpate around the buccal sulcus looking for any swelling or tenderness.
PA - need to locate the bite plate on the tooth you are most intertested in capturing, to ensure that you are able to capture to apex of that tooth.
Dx of irreversible pulpitis - if you can see distinct well defined periapical radiolucencies, then the Dx is not irreversible pulpitis, as the pulp will be necrotic for that to form. The Dx would ne necrotic pulp with symptomatic periapical periodontitis or acute periapical abscess or both, but irreversible pulpitis means the nerve is still alive and very inflamed and hypersensitive.
Before you start doing something like a whole mouth clean, have all your x-rays up and make sure you know exactly what is going on in their mouth before you start. make sure all the charting is accurate and up to day. if you see something in the mouth that is not on the chart, make sure you add it ASAP",Lvl 3: Student can be trusted to perform this task with indirect supervision,No,,Michelle Petterson,F_6zD8LpmfrawUJaN,signature.png,8726,image/png

We took an upper anterior PA of the root reminants and then extracted the tooth roots of the 27. I was the Support operator so I just helped with the extraction (suctioning), set up, wipedown and some notes. We noticed some pus come out from the third socket of the 27. There may have been a third root but because the gingiva covered the opening it was hard to see and the radiograph could not show it properly as it was only an OPG (and because it was a 2D image). Discussion about taking a future radiograph of that area to look for a potential third root was made. It was a very interesting pt case to me as I have never seen any with only tooth roots left in their mouth and requiring a FM clearance.","Great teamwork.

- first time using SDF, took longer than it should (knew the steps but unsure of execution and navigating new materials) 
- 2 or 3rd time used a retraction cord. Used two to get good retraction. I think it was faster than last time and was deep enough in the sulcus. I think I know now what to look for when placing it. ""Remember to remove it before polishing"" - I remembered this time but this is just good to remember anyways just in case
- Noted that the gingiva turned white when in contact with the SDF materials - was there a way to not get it on the gingiva? was difficult due to the caries being along the gingival margin. noting gingival mucosa cell turn over how long would it stain for. Is it a concern for pts?
- previous restoration was not removed completely just sanded back with a disk to allow for retention of new material and penetration of SDF? - is it because the previous restoration was GIC that this is okay? do we not need a smooth working surface for a sealed restoration? 
- ensure that the white precipitate disappears when applying SDF step 2.  (did this just a reminder!)
- First time using riva LC and photac, photac was harder to manipulate than I thought, try not to play with the material too much before curing if you want no voids. Photac is light cured (first capsule was wasted because I forgot to turn off my light). I tried placing it all in one go like other typical GIC restorations but there was a deficit on the palatal so just make sure that all surfaces are covered when squeezing the material (I fixed it up later and polished it down). I remembered a tip from DDS to always manipulate the material towards the margin to prevent deficits and I feel that really helped in this case. Polishing was fairly straight forward used disks and HS burs. Ensured the denture can be removed and put in well. 
- if there is a chance of infection, removal of retained root needs to be considered
- in this case because of the risk of MRONJ, there was more risk of extraction than leaving it since there is no apparent issues seen from the radiograph and the denture is covering it anyway --> removal of coral portion of GP and removal of caries was needed (13)
THINGS TO REMEMBER: 
- FORGOT TO ASK ABOUT BLOOD SUGAR READING (THIS IS IMPORTANT) - remembered for next pt but this needs to be done for all appts. 
- forgot to use articulation paper (seemed fine but it would've been better to check) 
- please take care when writing notes even when in a rush! Especially hand overs. 

Pt 2: 
- Perio chart: stage 4, grade C perio - considering, diabetes, age, bone loss and mobility.
- Lots of bleeding, calc and plaque 
- I feel like trying to notice when LA is needed for pts was a good skill to have today. Don't want the pt to be in unnecessary pain. 
- Calc bridge, needed to remove before probing, LA (mental blocks RHS, LHS)
- I feel like I was able to explain the perio relatively okay but not the best for this patient. I think they understood, together with the help of the hospital staff. I tried using my usual analogy about trees and roots and soil to create a picture in their head. I think this helped. I tried to stay away from jargon as much as possible (even words such as inflammation or inflamed) I've been doing this for other patients anyway but this patient I really made sure. (I used both inflamed and angry red and bleeding to cover both bases just in case they understood one way better than the other.) 
- IMPORTANCE OF OHI. (I've usually been pretty confident in my explaining and demonstrating ability but watching the difference between their two techniques (before and after OHI) was super rewarding). I could see where the inadequacies of brushing and interdental cleaning linked to their oral health. 
- Importance of concurrent perio and resto treatment. Need to manage both if they are both urgent. (either in the same appt or alternating)
- I felt like I was understanding of current OH habits but still firm.
- Remembered Blood sugar level this time!
- Come back to Tx plan --> how well they can manage their oral hygiene (note what the previous clinician said but you yourself think what is best for pt), SDF can halt progression but there is a need to restore if it is a plaque stagnation area/ cavitated. 
Need to work both resto side and perio side. ","The restoration was well done but need to make sure notes are  accurate including handover. root caries are usually better treated with SDF and restored with GIC without drilling the tooth. Use retraction cord for access.
when treatment planning in complex cases, need to prevent all dissease prorgession, can't just focus on perio or caries, need to plan to mange both concurrently.",Lvl 3: Student can be trusted to perform this task with indirect supervision,No,,Michelle Petterson,F_SUV6MSPTylGNKyB,signature.png,8652,image/png

The caries was more deeper than expected from radiograph and more time was required to manage the presenting complaint. Patient had subgingival caries, which made restoration more difficult and more tooth structure needed to be removed. 

Second patient slightly aggressive initially, needed an interpreter during appointment. During extraction of the tooth the crown broke, and the root had to be retrieved with root forceps. 
Observed how to suture and manage patient bleeding as well as how to work with an interpreter and patient that is resistant to advice about smoking and drinking alcohol.

Today's cons stressed the importance of isolation and material choice. Given the buccal caries extending slightly subgingivally, proper isolation was exceedingly difficult, lending to the material choice being GIC rather than resin composite. Understanding the difficulty in predicting caries extent from only a clinical exam ensures that I am not too locked in to a material choice, but rather to see how the cavity prep evolves and decide based on size, extent, isolation and other factors.

In terms of exos, root tip fracture of 14B root occurred. Understanding that the roots may be divergent and that these tips may be relatively thin ensures that in future exos of these teeth, that less force should be considered to ensure that they remain intact. Furthermore, more luxation should be considered to ensure sufficient mobility prior to forceps application. In addition, rotational movements may be undesirable due to there being two roots in these cases - careful and considered force application is paramount.

Finally, review of orifices in molar teeth is important to understand the location of orifices. For example, understanding the expected number of root canals and their locations. Watching videos of other clinicians accessing teeth may assist, as well as understanding the location of access.","Good patient communication and explanations.

Took a PA of the tooth to assess the area. Found it really challenging to place the sectional matrix, however, noticed that Thanh had placed the wedge AFTER the band and matrix. This was a good learning experience for me as I have not placed many sectional matrixes on patients. Overall, I think that the restoration also went well, though I left a couple of spots that needed more polishing than others. Considering I have not done a restoration since last year, I was happy with the result and so was the pt. 
Patient 2 - Placed one SSC using HT today. Removed the separator and noticed that the trial crowns weren't quite fitting the tooth how it should have. Thanh then adjusted the crown and flattened the wall, which I have not seen clinically before. Was also a good learning experience. This was only my second crown, and it went better than the first attempt. ","Pt 1: Seemed a little flustered today, needed help throughout.  Pt lost filling - incomplete gathering of info (did not check whether pt had any symptoms since filling dislodged). Identified caries when site was just covered in plaque and plaque not removed to check site properly. Issues with snapper-ray and film rotation - needed guidance. Wanted sectional matrix over Tofflemire system but not able to place. Issues with placement, wedge size selection - no consideration of smaller wedges when having issues with insertion. Needed help with whole system. Flowable composite is not self-cure! Positive: Aware of etch, primer and bond system. Nice filling and thoroughly checked occlusion with articulating paper.
Pt 2: Great SSC size selection and instructions to pt. Probably took a little too long with cleaning excess from mesial of tooth with floss - hence why could floss past contact anymore.

* Was able to complete all diagnostic tests required, and find the appropriate diagnosis without the need of supervision. 
* More able to differentiate between ENDO and EXO requirements, as this pt has almost sub-gingival breakdown with pulpal necrosis required crown lengthening for a successful ENDO in private. Otherwise EXO was more indicated as a better option to the low successful rate of ENDO. 
*  bisphosphonates medications does not contra-indicate the EXO procedure, unlike  bisphosphonates injection where EXO is indicated.  The risk of medications is very less  than injections of MRONJ after the EXO. 
* EXO final release technique: 90% of upper arch has a denser bone on the P, so the final release is B. Unless an infection is present on the P and therefore B release is more applicable. Lower arch final release for EXO is more towards the P because the bone on the B is denser. Upper teeth posterior is usually P and B movements.

I examined the pt and assess the 26, upon examination the 26 had an amalgam restoration that had fallen off and a large cavitation left (MOB). After questioning the pt, I found out that she had actually experienced severe pain two months ago (dec 2024) and when they arrived for their appt in Jan 2025, the pain was gone so they did not think too much of it. Special tests were conducted, TTP was -ve, TP was +ve, and -ve to cold tests. The PD were also fairly deep (B344, P355) and it was plaque stagnation area. I took a PA to get a closer look at the tooth, however my PA was not far back into the mouth and I was not able to see the apex as nicely as it should have been. I will need to make sure that the tooth being radiographed is directly on the bite block and the film behind it. The tooth was diagnosed as necrotic pulp with asymptomatic apical periodontitis with chronic apical abcess. It required an extraction. I did the LA on the pt, I did buccal and palatal infils on the pt using Articaine, but the pt wasn't numbed a lot, so with the guidance of my dds partner I also did an intraligamentary LA injection. The palatal infil was slightly difficult for me to complete as I haven't done one before but I was very grateful for my partner to give me some tips when I completed it. I passed the pt onto them after achieving anaesthesia on the pt.

(patient 2) 2nd pt of the day was an emergency pt, I saw them for the exam. Their main concern was about their upper left (26) pain and lower right pain. Upon examination, they had very heavy erosion and attrition on all their teeth. I completed TTP test and cold test (using endofrost). The pt was -ve on the 26 and 41 but everything else was vital, the TTP showed the 26 was +ve as well. An OPG was taken for the pt and from the radiograph, clinical findings and the pt's main concerns we decided to extract the 26. I passed the pt onto my DDS partner. The pt informed us that they did not drink soda and don't brush their teeth and did not like fluoride, however his teeth were relatively plaque free. I learnt that if there is a lack of plaque on a pt's dentition but they had heavy erosion then it would mean that they drank lots of acidic drinks as acid will erode enamel and also plaque as it is softer than enamel",good diagnosis and La technique,Lvl 4: Student can be trusted to perform this task independently,No,,aarti jaitlee,F_4OfmsrguWF8XhSN,signature.png,12285,image/png

Pt 2: 
This was an interesting case. Pt had not come in for a few months, so new PA was taken to assess progression of caries. On the radiograph, caries was close to the pulp, however still in my scope. This was a good opportunity to polish up on my investigation skills to assess if the tooth was reversible or irreversible Pulpitis. We did triplex test, TTP, took radiographs and cold test. The testings revealed it was drawing near to irreversible Pulpitis however as caution and a conservative method, a temporary filling was placed before assessing need for RCT. This opportunity has made me more confident on how to approach such a case where the pt presents with pain. During the caries removal, caries was removed from the peripheral and soft caries left at pulpal floor. We removed unsupported enamel. I was happy to apply what we learnt in sim on a real pt. Dycal and vitrobond used as medicament before using GIC. Needed some help with polishing from the supervisor. Pt was nervous but happy with outcome and I was happy to build good rapport. Next time for such a case, being more clear to them the future outcomes (potentially need RCT in future, symptoms may reappear etc etc). Otherwise very great learning opportunity. 

Pt 3: 
This was the third time I have seen this pt so definitely a good rapport was built. Pt had anxiety and thus by this apt, we had a really good idea of how to accomodate to his needs. We had suction on standby, had him sit more upright, and had a cup for him to rinse due to his sensory issues with spit collecting at the back of his mouth. Pt mentioned that he felt really comfortable and calmer throughout the apt. Also did a FS on the 36. Was slightly overfilled, which taught me an important to always check occlusion with articulating paper no matter how simple the procedure. I used a high speed round bur to polish it down and the pt was satisfied. 

Pt 4: 
First time I have seen shark teeth on a peads pt. Learnt that this is when the permanent tooth grows lingually, and is actually very common. Learnt some very important tips so that I can be better prepared to have a similar conversation if the situation arises in the future (e.g. telling the pt that it is common, that the permanent tooth will adjust into place due to the tongue’s forward movement etc). Also using wingtabs over snap-a-rays was very helpful as it was more comfortable for the pt and fit in him mouth better. 
","LA technique excellent
S/C quality overall very good. Reminder to remove plaque as well either with ems or prophy cup on smooth surfaces.
Remember to check occlusion after fissure sealants . 
Excellent isolation for tooth 36 and initial caries removal. Help required only because it was out of the scope for Aayasha. Dycal, vitrobond and Fuji II LC placement excellent.
Learnt about ‘shark teeth’ and the options involved.

Patient 5: 141. This patient was really sensitive and the original plan was to do LA and debride and perio chart quadrant by quadrant. But patient was good with sensitivity with the probe and only required topical so a full perio chart was able to be done. S5 had heavy deposits of calc so it a mass clean was also done so that the probe could get a more accurate reading. Within this lesson I thought about what would be the best for the patient in terms of time and thinking about how many session would be required for treatment to be complete. With the original plan it would have to be 4 sessions for each quadrant, but now it is reduced down to 2 sessions as the perio chart is complete and LA only required for Q1+2.

Pt 2: completed 013, 022, 024 as first PA did not capture apex, and a 534 for 13MIBP. The cavity prep was large  and it was borderline subgingival by the time I removed the soft caries. Supervisor ended up using a bit more slow speed to remove the demineralisation (white areas). I found the restoration for this tooth very difficult as I was unsure of how to approach it (palatal wall first? Mesial wall first? Buccal wall first?). At first I used the clear strip to try and create the mesial wall but it did not work, so I freehanded the buccal surface first. Then I used the tofflemire to create the mesial wall. I had thought about using the sectional matrix which dr Rutuja later said I should have used, however I think I was unsure and nervous about how to use it on anterior teeth as I had never done it on an anterior tooth. Since there was lots of bleeding, I had to use haemodent to try and stop the bleeding. It didn’t work quite well after we removed the retraction cord to use tofflemire so there were blood stains on the restoration margins. After restoring, luckily the restoration still allowed for patient to floss well, however, on the mesial wall, near cervical area it was quite rough and there was overhang. Next time, I will use sectional matrix to avoid this issue. I will also start with gingival floor and buccal and palatal. Build gingival wall and mesial wall with matrix before everything else. Buccal areas should be done in one increment to prevent defective margins. ","Good patient management.

For patient 2, I was happy with my pain history as I was able to get a full grasp of the patient's issues. Though no treatment was elected, I understood the logic behind this as inconclusive findings should not resort to unnecessary treatment.

For patient 3, I was able to perform an extraction of 26 with a degree of independence. I needed tips from my demo on which direction to move the tooth with the forceps. I learned to observe which side the tooth is leaning towards and to produce more movement in that direction as the tooth is likely to come out in that direction. I also learnt patient communication skills I will use going forward such as giving breaks and additional empathy as this would make the patient feel more comfortable.

Patient 4 was difficult as the extraction of the 15 involved a tooth with broken down coronal structure and a bulbous root. I needed heavy assistance from my demonstrator in removing this. I learnt that having a tight grip and orientating the forceps in the direction the tooth was rotated is crucial to getting movement. I learned that bulbous roots like to come out in a certain direction and to accommodate for that in my movement (clockwise/counter-clockwise). ","Patient 1 filling - Good final restoration.

I thought it would be a routine extraction as I was able to get mobility very quickly, however it turned into one that was longer than expected. The patient presented with pain on her LRHS on her 46 in the patient had an acute apical abscess and buccal cellulitis. The PA showed two large PARL on the mesial and distal roots and after giving the patient their options, she elected to extract the tooth. I was able to indepdently and in a timely manner give the patient a RHS IAN block, an infil, and intra ligamentary injections. I was able to independently and quickly get grade 2 mobility on the tooth by luxating. The patient felt no pain, however when I went to grasp the tooth with the lower hawk forceps the patient felt sharp pain. I applied my previous knowledge of the extent of an infection resulting in an acidic environment where the anaesthetic is not as effective. Thus, I gave the patient another block and an infiltration. The patient once again felt the same pain when attempting to deliver the tooth. My demonstrator then gave another block and an infiltration, but the patient still continued to feel pain due to the extent of the infection. The demonstrator attempted two more times but the same issue persisted. I learned that in these cases we can sometimes explain to the patient that when we start to reach the limit of LA, we can prescribe the patient antibiotics for the time being or we can explain that due to the extent of how mobile it is, we can attempt to take it out where they tolerate the pain for a few more seconds. In this case the patient elected to tolerate the pain and with one final attempt, the tooth was extracted. Due to the inability of the patient to get numb, the appointment went very long and thus I was only able to see one patient. I also learned that in some emergency cases we can give the patient nurofen and let them sit for 15 minutes before continuing. In this case, the patient did not want to do so.

Patient was 48 YO M, presented with Huntingtons disease and multiple psyhciatric medications (namely risperdone). Ths presented a challeging task to diagnose source of pain but also provide adequete service with minimal cooperation. Noting that pain can also stem from occlusion being unbalanced due to attrition or a built up composite that causes force in smaller distance to compound and cause tenderness, CO2 can be unaffected. Additionally posterior wisdom tooth restoraiton can be difficult. Consider case selection via positioning of the 8 relative to the ramus as well as basic responsitivity from the patient. THe longer the mouth remains open, the more the tongue will become obstructive. In Hind sight restoring should have been planned out abit better. if correct material was selected i.e RC, then using a smaller matrix ring followed by quicker bonding and placement would have led to a mor sustainable restoration. Instead due to constraints fuji 7 was used instead. 

Patient 2: 
Consider a through approach when doing a comprehensive exam. Outwards inwards (it has been a while). Remain methodical. As for perio exam, Do BPE, if pcokets 4mm or more on multiple quadrants, do a complete perio analysis (221). 

Patient 3: 
First anterior extripation. Diagnosis was fairly straightforward, however given pain and tenderness, RCT was the most viable tx. In regards to extripation on an anterior tooth, angulation is key, while following the axis and focusing on the crown, the root is important as it does become more narrow than the crown - much easier to perforate buccal surfaces of tooth or root than labial (rmndr to consistently check access). ","'- good feedback to yourself here. 
-i agree a quick and methodical approach and starting with a bite prop would have helped with the 48 filling. comitment to matrix would also help. need to have the hard ocnversations about trauma to soft tissues even when it's because of the patient's difficult positioning. 
- exam good, but yes methodical reporting helps us follow along with findings and plan
- extirpation I wathced went well. just keep checking you line angle while accessing to ensure you are on target. ",Lvl 3: Student can be trusted to perform this task with indirect supervision,No,,"alice gubbins ",F_bI0zTfliUKDEVC9,signature.png,9830,image/png

I completed the 011 on the pt, the appt went smoothly I was able to finish the E/O, I/O soft and hard tissues, occlusion assessment, BPE and denture assessment before the appt was over. The pt wanted to adjust their lower partial dentures as it was loose, since adjusting dentures were not in my scope of practice, I handed it over to my partner to help them. The pt got their dentures made overseas (thailand) and I noticed that their hard palate had denture marks and after asking them about their denture habits I found that they wear their upper denture 24/7 the lower one was not worn because it was uncomfortable. I informed them about the risks of constantly wearing dentures and also how to take care of them.

(patient 2) 4th pt of the day came in for a CONS appt. I asked the pt if they had any tooth in particular they wanted to restore as the tx plan from the previous clinician had multiple teeth which would not have been possible to complete all in a 60 minute appt. The pt informed me about their 23IP restoration which had fallen off, they wanted it to be replaced so I restored that tooth. The pt did not want rubber dam as they were very uncomfortable when using it in the past so I opted to do a dry guard and cotton roll isolation instead. This worked well and because it was a maxillary tooth so the saliva wouldn't reach it as easily. The restoration went smoothly as well. Since I was originally going to use the rubber damn I had wanted to do a ligature on the pt's tooth. My DDS partner offered to teach me how to make a proper floss ligature after the pt left. This was very helpful because all my previous ligatures weren't made properly (they allowed the dam to sit comfortably, but I had to cut it off each time which was not ideal). I was taught the single and double ligature. I'll practice it at home and hopefully get the chance to use it on my future pts.","good pt and time management - take care to have #trtpln B4 #timeout - could not give consent before risks discussed.

Overall, I feel that I'm improving on efficient diagnosis and working quickly and more independently.

The first visit was a 47B restoration and S/C. I was happy with the restoration as it was quite subgingival and I am getting more comfortable using retraction cords.

Secondly, I had a young pregnant patient who needed a large restoration (17DOB) where I used selective caries removal for the first time in a while. I was pleased with the restoration and especially with the distal  marginal contour, however the occlusal surface could have been polished better as the resin composite increment lines were visible.

The third visit was a difficult 36 extraction as profound anaesthesia could not be achieved despite a lot of LA being used, and the mesial root was curved. I learned about elevating roots out of sockets where there is interseptal bone blocking the path of removal. For this I needed Dr Alice's help.

Lastly, I saw a patient who recently had an extraction here and was having persistent soreness. I learned about what extraction sockets look like before they are fully healed. We normally don't see this in RDHM so I was unfamiliar.","'- checking occlusal surfaces - 16 was high so need to polish and check filling from different contours/ views. definitely had a lovely D contour.

However once we began to apply forceps, it was determined that there may be more divergence of the roots than we had initially assessed. This was a difficult procedure as it required the supervisor to perform a sectional extraction. Along with this, there was extensive infection that made it difficult to establish profound anaesthesia throughout the procedure. For this reason, the patient required multiple injections throughout in order to ensure that the procedure was not causing any pain/discomfort. I learned a lot through this experience as both the patient factors (anaesthesia), as well as removal of the tooth were quite difficult. I have learned how to troubleshoot through such procedures with the help of the demonstrator, and it was also my first time providing intraligamentary infiltrations.

First pt: 4yo for 75O 

What I did good: Building patient rapport was key for this appt as the pt is very young. They were in good spirits and initially compliant. Allowing the pt to have control and not force them to do the procedure. Utilised patient management skills i.e. explaining in novelty terms and taking breaks. 

What I could improve on: Attempted PA with snap-a-ray and bitewing tab but unfortunately pt was not compliant and was uncomfortable. I believe this set up this appt to be quite unpleasant for them. Due to this experience, we were not able to take the PA, and supervisor advised to not use LA to prevent more unpleasant experience but pt was very sensitive during the attempt to use the HS bur. Was not able to complete caries removal and decided it was best to try again next appt, with LA. 

Second pt: Pain, COE and Debridement 

What I did good: COE, debridement and tx planning. OHI explanation was detailed and comprehensive catering it to the pt. Was firm in explaining to pt that GVH does not provide retainers. 

What I could improve on: Prophy polishing could be less messy - mindful of pedal pressure to reduce motor speed so it does not fly everywhere.

For instance, the management of dry socket and reviewing these conditions and how to prevent them will play a crucial role in building good rapport with patients and ensuring good outcomes. Importantly, accurate diagnosis and understanding the symptoms and signs of this condition are also paramount.

Additionally, today was the first opportunity to perform a surgical exo. Understanding when a surgical exo is indicated, how to perform it, decisions on where to place incisions and where to remove bone all play a pivotal role in the success of this procedure. Furthermore, preparing patients prior to beginning of this occurring is important to ensure that patients are kept in the loop and don't feel blindsided/believe you have slipped up as you have pre-faced the possibility.

Finally, understanding how to manage anxious patients by trying to figure out what exactly they're anxious about and how to assist in allieviating these anxieties were crucial for today's procedures. Offering distraction techniques, discussing the root cause of anxieties and how to resolve them and offering a willing ear to listen all can be effective strategies. Review of more techniques may also assist this practice.","Impression - good. Management of dry socket also good.

The first patient presented with pain on her LLHS. I was able to independently take the appropriate investigations and was able to diagnose that her pain on the 36 RCT tooth was likely due to occlusal force. I was then able to reduce the height of the resin composite onlay and the patient explained it already felt better once doing so. I learned that in these cases when there are no active infections or obvious reasons for the pain, even a slightly high occlusion can cause pain. My second patient required much more patience as they required an interpreter. The patient was complaining about pain on his LLHS where the 36 and 35 were heavily infected with large PARLs. The 36 was referred for surgical exo where as the patient was open for retreatment on the 35. However, the patient had a difficult time understanding the options which resulted in a longer appointment. The patient also complained they cannot eat with their current denture as it is loose. I was able to adjust the denture using pressure paste and the patient said it felt much better. I have not done many adjustments and there was a prosthodontist in the clinic who was able to assist me in explaining what to look for. I learned that when I put the pressure paste I can place gauze or a cotton roll and get the patient to bite to see where the denture is impinging. My last patient felt pain on their 31 and felt that something broke off, but in this case it was just calculus that had broken off and revealed her sound tooth. This was a severe case of perio where I was able to give the patient a S/C + SRD under LA to address the inflammation and pain. Overall, I believe I managed my time well as I completed all three appointments in the allotted time and learned how to approach specific cases when the investigations may not reveal an obvious pathology. Moreover, I have wanted to learn more about denture adjustment, so this was a good case where I now know what to look for as it had been a while since I had completed a denture.

Today involved observing 2 cases of paediatric patients who were unable to be seen in chair and hence were booked for GA. The first patient involved an extraction and preventative work whilst the second involved restoration of 4 teeth and extraction of 2 others. The first patient was an interesting case as the patient was very uncooperative which meant achieving anaesthesia was very difficult before the dental team could  begin. This highlighted to me that whilst GA is an option for patients who find in chair dental care too difficult, GA still has its set of challenges which should still be accounted for. The second patient was interesting in that we were able to see the depth of work that we aim to achieve with GA, in that a large number of items were completed within the GA. We were able to see the clinical workflow for GA, which had a significant multi-disciplinary component through the anaesthetics team. 

I am now more aware of what is involved specifically in GA treatment, alongside working with other healthcare workers which enables me to provide more informed advice when referring a patient for GA treatment.

- implant hygiene  and education needs to improve using more visual aids would help the pt to understand better.

Tooth was fractured mesially, attempted to extract using both wide and narrow luxators to begin, once luxated enough I placed cow horns as apically as possible and utilized squeezing and pumping motions (due to cow horn instrument) initially had good movement but the mesial lingual cusp fractured. I then elected to luxate more in order to not fracture the crown any further. During luxating distally, the distal portion of the crown fractured off equicrestally, losing the purchase point. At this point most of the crown was fractured off (mesial was already lost at patients presentation).  Got help from Dr. Iola and Dr. Thomas on pathforwad, decided to continue extraction with luxators but the tooth fractured further. We then moved forward and set up for a surgical extraction. Observed Dr. Thomas and assisted as need, suggesting using cryers and it ended up working for the mesial root so im happy about that. But frustrated with crown fracture to begin with.

The patient did not experience any sensitivity or pain, and  wanted to leave. However, the lesion is nearing the pulp and could also lead to symptoms of caries and sensitivity. To avoid this,  a restoration is recommended. This  lesion, however likely started by abrasion. 

IMPORTANCE OF  OHI.
Although the patient is aware of the modified bass technique and uses piksters that was previously recommended, you still have the responsibility to demonstrate the techniques and review the patient's technique. The OHI should be given thoroughly so the patient understands the importance and should not be given lightly. The patient needs to understand the impact of their hygiene. Could have used more GC Tri gel on the lower arch, as the first attempt only provided faint colours. On the second attempt, it was a more accurate display. Any procedure or advise should be done thoroughly, otherwise there is no point in doing it at all. Although debridements are very helpful in calculus removal, there are other important factors such as the patient's brushing techniques, their oral hygiene at home, and your provision of OHI. 

The patient didn't have a lot of calculus buildup, but rather plaque. So what is your next step? What will help the patient more? In this case, it is reinforcing OHI and plaque disclosing. Debriding shouldn't be given the most importance in this case as there are other approaches that needed to be done thoroughly first. 

Notes: Be thorough with treatment planning. Which surfaces are the restorations being done? The discussion and options are for the options section, no need to do it again in the agreed treatment plan. Ensure your notes are saved, and be thorough with record keeping. 

Could have managed time better today. Half the time was used in redoing in the plaque disclosing, as this time could have been allocated to OHI and debridement. 

","Lots to take away from today, it's great to see you have made notes on  several aspects of  the appointment and lots of the things we discussed. To summarise, it's really  important that you start to work more thoroughly, being thorough is the key to patient centred care and providing the best treatment to the patient. Todays patient had heavy plaque deposits, it's important that we educate the patient before  we start debriding and empower and encourage better behaviour in the patient by giving her an opportunity to see and remove the plaque herself. After redoing  the plaque disclosing, you  were running behind and  had to rush your debridement, remember to get support if you need it.",Lvl 1: Student can not be trusted to perform this task,No,," Monica Ramzy",F_3lSJvbw4lJyMFPT,signature.png,9977,image/png

Patient 1 - radiographs,  MODL restoration. 

Very difficult restoration due to extensive deep carious lesion. Ended up removing the whole buccal and lingual wall while leaving pulpal caries to prevent pulp exposure. Required demonstrator assistance with clearing DEJ caries as I was unsure how deep I should go. 

Managed to isolate subgingival margin with rubber dam and complete a MODL resin composite restoration with tofflemire matrix band. Slightly open contact on the distal wall, and could be improved by building up the lingual and buccal wall first with tofflemire then ppe to lacing a sectional matrix to build up the distal wall. 

Overall, very good learning experience and hope to improve on assessing how deep to go with caries removal.

The pt couldn't speak english very well, so her son helped to translate. The pt had pain on her LHS both Upper and Lower teeth. Upon examination there were bridges in that area (24-26, 34-36) and futher investigations (TTP,TP, pulp sensibility tests, PA) to assess the pain determined that the tooth was not in pain because of infection but rather due to traumatic dental occlusion and widening of the PDL due to inflammation. I did a localised debridement around the bridges to help clean the area to allow the PDL to heal and then informed the pt of the options that they had to address the pain (seeing a private dentist, TMJ specialist or public - RDHM specialist) to help fix their bridge due to the heavy occlusion. The pt had night guards that they did not wear so that was also suggested to them to wear as it would help with the night-time grinding they experienced. The pt also mentioned that they had recently lost a business and are in a tough financial situation, that would have contributed to their stress which would have increased the chances of them grinding at night. I didn't realise this until my partner discussed it with me and the pt, next time I will need to take everything into consideration.

(patient 2) 3rd pt of the day came in for a debridement, I had seen them 2 weeks before when I was supporting a different DDS student. The pt was anxious but was able to sit through the whole appt patiently. They had very limited mouth opening so it was very difficult to clean the posteriors, I ended up using hand scalers (Gracey curettes) to debride it as the EMS was too large to fit deeply into the pt's mouth. I made sure to reassure the pt throughout the appt, telling them that they did a good job and can tell me to stop whenever they wanted to take a break or got nervous.

What I did well: Restoration placement was a lot better than the first time, with some minor voids that could be adjusted. LA technique was good and ensured pt felt comfortable.

Improvements: 
- Today was a good reminder in always considering the RFP, and the crucial importance of informed consent for procedures, that in collaborating with the patient we can have patient centered care.

Waitlist exam. Huge med hx. Pt was actually prepared and had a med list and dr contact info at hand. Had a prosthetic heart valve placed ~4 years ago. Tooth was going to be exo’d today and I mentioned the potential need for antibiotic prophylaxis. Demo said highly unlikely so we don’t really have to check with pt’s med team. Patient was certain he is fine and doesn’t need antibiotics. Operator and I were more concerned so I got a hold of the surgeon who said no. Tooth was exod. Then surgeon called back and said actually yes do it. So pt had to come back to pick up a script. I am happy I urged checking about this to prevent future problems for the pt. 
He was also offered a voucher for F/F dentures by our demo which I did not know was an available option instead of waiting on the general denture waitlist. Asked about this to demo and he said it’s only at demo’s discretion for patients who they think will be difficult to manage during denture fabrication. It is unfair for other patients but there as a last resort to save public system from hassles if anticipated. 

Pt 2. Assisted a BOH colleague and noted that she is very good with her chair positioning and asking the patient to move their head which is something I often fail to do and will try to more regularly. Was able to give a second opinion when she was unsure during charting and give advice during her restoration when asked. We tried to use an interproximal strip to remove an amalgam overhang where calculus was building up but the contact was extremely tight and the demo said this is often unsuccessful which it was. Tried to use a tip from another demo and use a hollenback to separate the teeth a little but the instrument broke. 

Pt 3. lost filling from two days before. uncomplicated crown fracture 11 but half the tooth size. took tooth out of occlusion and a more defined enamel bevel (only on the buccal, not palatal as demo said it would not help).

This required a booking with PC surgical for removal of the decoronated tooth. For the tooth experiencing the sensitivity the demonstrator recommended two options- protective layer with bond + duraphat application and monitor or to place a resin composite restoration over the tooth. The patient opted for duraphat application, so this appointment was more straightforward. The second patient was triaged for gingival pain, however it turned out to be more complex. This was a young patient undergoing orthodontic treatment and was experiencing pain in the 16. The tooth required extirpation, however we required a second opinion from an orthodontist due to the braces. We were able to find an available orthodontist to assess the patient and he recommended pausing orthodontic treatment until the root canal treatment is complete and removed the wire from the tooth/adjacent tooth to allow for rubber dam placement. There was also a metal band on the tooth as well as brackets on adjacent teeth which made it difficult to place the clamp. Once the tooth was accessed it was difficult to locate all canals due to possible pulpal stones and thin canals. The palatal canal was extirpated and the patient was referred to endo specialists for completion of the RCT. Although difficult this was a great learning experience. In terms of areas of improvement, I could have done better with time management and my access cavity as it became quite large while trying to locate the canals. Improvement will come with further review and practice in clinic.

The denture addition was relatively straightforward, however remembering to ensure the occlusion is balanced on the new tooth and to ensure it is unlikely to continue to fall off is important.

Shade matching was ok for the anterior restoration, however review of the shade matching protocols will prove useful.

Finally, management of the patient with autism proved to be a new challenge. For instance, taking time to listen to the concerns of this patient, what they were comfortable with and what was bothering them - in essence, the same as any other patient just with some heightened sensitivities. Furthermore, planning for GA and understanding that you would lean on more aggressive treatment in these cases and how that affects treatment planning. This considers the prognosis and the risk factors that have caused the patient to require this treatment in the first place. Finally, understanding how the patient's motivations - in this case the patient felt hopeless and unable to control their oral health - and how to work towards building confidence and belief in their own abilities and to take back control felt quite overwhelming but I believe we managed to make some small steps towards that.","Insert of denture addition handled independently

 417 (22) - Dental dam placement was tricky due to GIC almost being equigingival, and gingiva riding up on to cingulum, making clamp placement difficult. Instead of single tooth isolation, we opted for 3-3 isolation with premolar clamps on both canines for better retention of the dam. Still unable to get the dental dam all the way down around the palatal CEJ of the 22 due to the proximity of the GIC to the gingival margin.

Pt 2 - This was an interesting case with a child that had a class III occlusion but could not be referred to RDHM ortho as her permanent incisors/molars had not erupted. We took some photos but there was not much we could with the referral.

- The final patient presented w/ a hx of trauma to the 21.
- By observing Dr. Scott and hand filing myself, I learned how to negotiate calcified pulp chambers to extirpate the root canal. More specifically, I developed specific strategies such as 1) widening the access cavity to improve visual access and 2) learning the tactile sensation. Additionally, Dr. Scott and I discussed other tools that have been developed to manage calcified pulp chambers such as diamond-tipped EMS that are used specifically in these scenarios. 

Accurate assessment of healing extraction sites:
- Today, I was assessing the healing of an extraction site and mistook food/debris for bone/granulation tissue. I felt very silly after this consult despite my demonstrator reassuring me that this is a common mistake. I realized that I feel nervous and scared to disturb extraction site due to their delicate nature; as a result, I am not assessing them by probing, palpating, and rinsing. I now understand that to accurately assess an extraction site, I need to be more thorough in my assessment and this involves palpating and feeling the area for soreness/tenderness, rinsing with a triplex, and drying with air. While I should be gentle, I also need to be thorough.

Patient 2
First time doing exo on a child; things I learnt:
- Use a full cartridge when numbing even primary teeth
- When giving infiltration, give buccal infiltration but for linguals, give two points near interdental papilla area and watch for proper bleaching
- Use universals for Ds, hawks for Es
- It’s okay if the roots don’t come out in one piece, most likely they are well resorbed anyways
- no apical pressure !! Just buccolingual movements
- when placing forceps, place one beak buccally make sure you have good grip then place lingual beak; it’s okay if it slides deeper, unlikely to damage permanent, be more worried about getting good grip fast and taking it out fast ","good variety of patients today

Fairly complex medical history and most dentition was carious which produced unclear pulpal responses when using endofrost. During the appointment I learnt how to set up the OPG, as per Frankfurt plane and midline, with canine guidance.

In terms of positioning for the periapical radiographs of the 26 and 27, i want to improve my positioning more to capture more of the apex.

Demonstrated good communication and patient and comprehensive treatment plan.

2nd patient: Fairly straight forward scale and clean with prophy paste to remove any staining. Patient was comfortable and satisfied with the visit. I also noted plaque stagnating margins on the existing amalgam restoration.

Key take away from this encounter was having the diffiuclt conversation that restorability options are limited and that attempts at restoration would not lead to the desried function that patient was after i.e wanting to chew and enjoy a stake (pt. was edge to edge with severe attrition, and posterior occluding units <5). His key complaint of bloody gums was addressed when ever he ate something strong - explained by the calculus build up in lower lingual surfaces that had already stretched the gingiva out and inflammed it.  Treatment planning for this case would have been interesting as he would have requred a full mouth rehab to restore his desired level of function. 

Patient 2:  Anterior restoration patient with reduced restorability space. Straight forward case, patient was elderly, had to accomodate inability to use R.dam, on top of allowing pt to drink some water due to inability to swollow - meant having to redo bonding protocol. Addiitonally, refining the prep on the 23 meant contouring the cingulum more precisely and adjusting multiple times while checking the bite, especially when attrition is involved. 

Patient 3 - Reutrn patient from yestday. Today a relatively loose 13 was extracted. Pick up impression taken of upper denture for an additon of 13 + 23. Inserton of the denture went smoothly with a minor adjustment to reduce plaque traping.

Dr Alice's advice to adjust the fitting surface rather than the added acrylic teeth was very invaluable. I also asked this patient to fill in my multi-source feedback form.

The outcome achieved was decent, but the surface can be smoother I feel. For my next patient, she needed a 44 exo.

For cons, the main takeaway is ensuring that the DEJ is clear, and understanding how deep the pulp is. Reviewing anatomy and rough guidelines for the depth of pulp will assist in determining the amount of caries removal before there is potential for pulpal exposure, especially if there are high pulp horns. In regards to ensuring good interproximal margins, deciding whether to use clear matrices or tofflemire bands depends on the degree of tooth structure loss and what is achievable in each situation.

For exams, ensuring the margins of existing restorations are thoroughly assessed will ensure no caries are missed. Furthermore, review of ICDAS 3 lesion mx, especially if smoothing is possible may ensure a more conservative approach than full caries removal and restoration.

Finally, understanding options when trismus is involved in swelling situations assists in the diagnostic process. For example. an OPG may prove useful when I/O view is limited. Furthermore, providing antibiotics as an interim solution to reduce pain and swelling prior a review appointment may assist in future treatment planning. Though not a permanent solution as the cause of the infection is not cleared, it may aid in the diagnostic process.","Good use of RD again. 34 restoration - good margin. Good patient communication

(patient 1) 1st pt of the day was a pregnant women who came in for a CONS appt. I completed the 45DO restoration removal and redo of the restoration. I believe the procedure went smoothly, however, I also ran over time. This may have been because I started late, but I think I also spent a bit too long trying to do the cavity prep as I was afraid it would go too deep/subgingival which would have then been out of scope. Thankfully it did not and I was able to successfully restore the tooth. For the future, I need to make sure to consistently start on time (have everything prepared; wipedown, setup, materials all gathered especially even my Assistant isn't running late).
(patient 2) 2nd pt of the day was a mental health client who also came in for a CONS appt. They were upset about entering the clinic late due to me running over time with the 2st pt so I apologised for it. The pt had 3 teeth indicated for restorations but since they wanted to go and eat lunch and leave the appt early I only did 1 simple one (21MP). Since the pt was a mental health client, they kept asking questions about the procedure and how soon they could leave the clinic to eat. I tried my best to answer their questions without upsetting them and making them anxious, especially when they asked about the rubber dam placement as it was taking a while for me to place on them due to the crowding in their teeth. This was a new experience for me (rubber dam on crowded teeth) as I haven't done it previously and it was a nice challenge to have. Overall, the appt went well and the restoration was completed and finished on time for the pt to leave.","good pt management and communication. good cons result.

Pt 3: Communication and tailored care 
My final pt presented was reluctant to receive care from students, had complex social history, and a compromised dentition. For example, he heavily smoked, had no intention to quit. Also, he had lack of access to a home/bathroom to perform oral hygiene and general hygiene regularly. And finally, he planned to travel cross-country for the upcoming year. My priorities included managing his expectations and building trust. 

In this appointment, I used a few strategies to establish rapport and effectively communicate the prognoses of his teeth and treatment options. 

Namely, I:
1) Changed my body language and vernacular to more closely match his. Instead of being bubbly and preppy, I tried to seem more relaxed and straight forward.
2) Demonstrated sympathy for his compromised dentition and the impact this must have on his ability to eat, socialize, and self esteem
3) Encouraged him to continue to come in for regular dental checkups and used positive affirmation to make him feel like he is on the right track by coming into today's appointment. 
4) Recognized that the best solution for this patient was something low maintenance, that did not require regular attendance, and he was hesitant to change his smoking habit and would need to be motivated to change his hygiene habits. 
5) Built trust by being transparent with him about what the prognoses of his teeth was and foster accountability. For example, his posterior teeth could have fair prognoses if his habits changed but I explained that this was upto him. If he did not make changes, then these teeth would need to be extracted in the future as well. I also explained the length of time required for the extraction-denture fabrication process to help the patient understand how this would fit into his long term plans for travel.

The decision to use rubber dam vs cotton roll isolation, and material choice was covered today and chosen to reflect the unique patient and tooth situation. For example, the restorations that were closer to the gingival margin (equigingival-subgingival) provides a situation that is difficult to use rubber dam. Further review of the restorative material choice, especially for root caries should be conducted to ensure that the most ideal material is used in each case. In this case, the decision between resin composite and GIC depends on the ability to get moisture control, which may or may not be achievable depending on the tooth and its distance from the gingival margin.

Furthermore, understanding when anaesthetic should be used was explored today.

Deep preps on both teeth today. Unable to achieve Haemostasis on the 36DO. I tried to use cotton pellet + hemodent to stop bleeding however was unsuccessful after 10 minutes. Decided to do a temporary restoration with GIC today and a definitive restoration with resin composite later. Used tofflemire + wooden wedge, no voids or deficiencies, contact achieved, successful restoration. This experience taught me if I cannot achieve haemostasis after 5 minutes, I can explain to the patient that a temporary restoration is the best option for today and we can do a definitive restoration later. Patients are receptive to honesty and appreciate that you want to do good work for them. 35 anatomy and space between the 35 and 36 made achieving a contact difficult and would’ve made the restoration very bulky on the distal aspect. Advised the patient the contact will not be as tight and keeping the area clean is very important. Through my DDS training, I realize the importance of managing patient expectations. When patients understand the reason behind the outcome, I find through my experience, they are more understanding. Overall, both restorations were successful.

I also observed a lower anterior extraction in which the forceps were moved in a medial-distal direction and was held in each position to mobilize the tooth. This helped in speeding up the exo by gaining mobility.

I also observed a restoration on a lower premolar and how caries was removed by using tactile feedback to determine whether the caries was hard or soft.

I also learned how to manage a patient with pain if diagnosis is inconclusive. A pt came with pain however, after special texts and radiographs, the diagnosis was still inconclusive. To manage, our demo recommended to polish the current restoration as well as give a clean and to monitor and see the patient again in 2 weeks as it was recommended to be conservative.

Sc/c without LA for this pt. No calc was remaining post debridement. Pt had double TMJ surgery so next time remembering to give a lot more breaks is vital to ensure she is comfortable. Otherwise, I was happy that I had time to go thru OHI, as the pt mentioned she was having difficulty with cleaning her tongue. I was able to give her recommendations on how to clean her tongue (e.g. with a tongue scraper rather than with a TB). Pt was willing to give it a try. Good overall session today. 

Pt 2: 
Was a sc/c apt. Pt had autism and had requests to make her apt more comfortable (she also did not like the feeling on saliva at the back of her mouth). She advised her that playing with tissue paper, wearing sunglasses (the room was too bright), holding the small suction herself has been helpful for her in the past. Also gave pt a lot of breaks and talked her through the procedure to ensure she was well informed and not caught off guard by any sensation. I am starting to feel more comfortable asking pt about their medical conditions and what helps them feel more comfortable in the chair. Compared to the beginning of 2nd year where I felt uncomfortable to ask. I have learnt an important lesson that it is always important to ask these questions as it can prevent incidents but also help build pt rapport. 

Pt 3: 
Did the exam today. I think I need to work more on hard tissue and understand what could be staining vs caries, unsatisfactory restoration or not etc. I still have difficulty sometimes telling the difference. Although this can be improved on with more experience, I will also revise some theory at home and work on some case studies to familiarise myself of the differences. Otherwise exam went well and a max sc/c was completed with no calc remaining.

Pt 4: 
FM sc/c with no calc remaining. I have been trying to use my previous feedback of using floss, drying the teeth and using the probe to detect for any residual calc. Due to taking on that advice, I have improved in my sc/c today.

Pt 5: 
Pt had two GIC temp fillings and came in for a rv. I recognised that there was a marginal deficiency for one of the filling, to which I advised topping up with additional GIC. Simple apt, however pt was very anxious. I ensured that mum was by her side so she could hold her hand, distracted her with non-dental conversations and ensured that dental terminology was translated into kid-friendly language (E.g. conditioner as shampoo, GIC as icing). Pt felt for relaxed after.

What I did well: LA technique was good, able to identify the depression and injection site for RHS IANB. LA was profound which was a great sign. Debridement technique was good and was able to remove the chunks of calculus. Communication was overall good too in explaining OHI. 

What I could improve on: Communication and motivational interviewing for OHI and periodontal disease could improve as it briefly discussed. Being able to cohesively discuss their condition, may be more helpful in motivating them to improve OH at home. They were receptive however do feel like it may be a bit in-genuine as they were not truthful on their regular OH at home in the beginning of the appt. 

Pt 2: 011, Debridement, BWs
 
What I did well:  Overall did well with pt in listening to their concerns and goals for dental tx. Technique for debridement was good. BWs were good considering pt did not have molars on LHS. Pt was receptive to OHI and thus was a good indicator that communication was good. Pt was very thankful and after the clean felt better esp with denture wearing. 

What I could improve on: Time management - pt did not have a lot of teeth to clean but still took up a bit of time to ensure everything was clean. 

Pt 3: 011, BWs, 46OB CR + F/S 47O 

What I did well: Communication regarding the importance of fluoride, linking it back to the pt and their young kids, as well to their existing dental condition. LA technique was good, anesthesia was profound for the RHS IANB. CR and F/S for 47O was satisfactory. 

What I could improve on: Time management and caries identification (in terms of tx planning - f/s vs restore) - took awhile with the caries removal. Dental materials needs to be revised - thought of using dentine conditioner for conseal FS but phosphoric etch is suitable due to mechanical bonding.

patient 6: failed cons. pt presented for restorations. due to the subgingival nature of the restoration, I had to stop however when placing the fuji restoration, I found that the temporary restoration was quite rough and required lots of smoothing. in hindsight, leaving the restoration and having it completed by DDS would have been a wiser idea rather than removing the restoration and placing a temporary.","if you don't feel comfortable and it is not within your scope, just complete a restoration that is within scope. there was another tooth that could have been restored instead ",Lvl 3: Student can be trusted to perform this task with indirect supervision,No,,Katarzyna Ligudzinski,F_2tl3EIwY4zBvdcU,signature.png,9753,image/png

I had to book in the full 3 hours for this patient as they are deaf and thus it is difficult to communicate. It requires more patience and time as patient is also very anxious about dental procedures and LA. Overall, I was able to effectively communicate with the patient about what I was going to do, in terms of 2 restorations, as well as explaining each step in order to give them more comfort. I was able to independently give the patient LA, isolate, prep and restore the 16MO and 17DO. I was able to independently remove all caries on the 16 and 17 as well as identify that the caries on the 16 occlusal floor was very deep and elected to leave caries, which my demonstrator agreed with. Moreover, I was able to independently place a tofflemire matrix on both teeth and restore accordingly. A few things I learned is that when the caries are deep, it is not always necessary we place vitrebond as recent studies do not indicate the use of it in these cases as the resin is enough. Moreover, when I completed my restorations, I had some excess/catch on the 17D and 16M. I had attempted to smooth out the 17D with a soflex disc, however I learned that it can generate a lot of heat and is much harder to access when compared to using a high speed flame bur without water. The 16M just needed to be rounded off a bit more which was completed with a high speed flame bur. Overall, I was proud of the result as the restorations came out great indicated by its marginal seal and smoothness. Moreover, I was able to complete the restorations before the appointment ended, given that the patient also came in 20 minutes late, so I believe it was good time management given the patient's circumstances.",As above - nice restorations - good patient communication [difficult as deaf].,Lvl 4: Student can be trusted to perform this task independently,No,,Dr Nathan Pitchforth,F_24PmgO4SniaDOvX,signature.png,8317,image/png

The 2nd pt, was extremely difficult, where the pt was feeling intense pain, dysesthesia, in which no odontogenic cause is to be found. 
- The 22 prognosis was poor to hopeless, in which restoration of the tooth was difficult, thus warranting extraction. The 2nd pt felt mis-understood as we were unable to come to a cause of the problem, in which an oral medicine referral was made. The 2nd pt was hard to come to terms with, as we are unable to help the pt with the patient's pain, being non-odontogenic.
- The extraction of the 1st pt was valuable to observe, and to observe the operator's technique in elevation and luxation. The 2nd pt was a valuable experience in the challenge of empathising with the pt's pain, though being out of our scope.
- Learning about extraction technique will prove beneficial, and revising extraction options.

I was looking forward to seeing her and seeing how the periodontist's treatment could affect the patient's oral hygiene. However, she FTA'd, and I called and left a voice message to reschedule.
The second patient came late because they mistakenly waited in level 1 rather than level 2. Good that I called them or they will miss out half of a session. 
The patient did not speak English and stopped me a few times during the perio chart because she wanted the 11 to be taken care of. The son went out to move his car and hence took a long time to explain that I need to look at the full mouth as a whole before treatment. 
At the end I came to the conclusion that the patient has Stage 4 Grade B periodontitis as CAL is more than 6mm, and bone loss is at apical 1/3 of root at the most severe site. Ideally Stage 4 Perio patients should be referred to periodontists immediately but this patient had multiple grade 2/3 mobility teeth, and would benefit from management from me for OHI and debridement prior to the referral.
Reason for taking 11PA: checking inflammation indicated by radiolucency, widened PDL?

Before the appointments started I helped wipedown the bay and gather all the necessary equipment for the first few patients .
The first pt was an emergency, I helped with the notes. My DDS partner who was examining them decided to restore the pt's 36DOB as it was the reason for the pt's discomfort. I was able to watch my partner use the gingival retraction cord along the gingiva to restore the tooth (it had severe abfraction, all the way down the root to where the furcation was). It was interesting to see such a large buccal restoration as I hadn't seen one before. The appointment ran over time and we had to bring in the 2nd pt very late. 
With the help of the YCH DA, I wiped down and set up the bay for the next pt as quickly as I could whilst still following the infection control procedures.
2nd pt was booked for a CONS appt (27M) I assisted with notes, material gathering and suctioning etc for the operator.

Since I'm with a new DDS partner and in a new room this week, I liked how the room had 2 trays for me to use as I was able to alternate between the trays when setting up the bay for the next pt.

Overall fairly difficult to see and apply the materials. Cheek guard was my best friend for protection of buccal mucosa and moisture control. Consider how clean the surface is (calc? plaque? debris?) that should be cleaned off before the procedure. We want a clean surface to work with that won't just result in a poor restoration that traps plaque. Then how to clean is important. EMS? Hand instruments? Sickle scaler? We don't want to induce bleeding that could potentially impact moisture control.
Second time using SDF - Found it easier to use, as I remembered the steps, but it was difficult to place due to the location of the lesion. Found that bending the microbrush to more than a 90 degree angle worked well for control. 
Second time with cotton roll isolation on adult. Lots of saliva, remember the change the cotton rolls/ cheek guards when needed (wet). I was able to keep the area dry this appt but sometimes I would notice the cheek guard was damper than ideal. 
Attempted to use V3 matrix band, should try it again. Even when pressing on the matrix band as hard as possible to shape the fuji 9, (fuji 9 used because it would have been difficult to fit the light cure in that area) it flicked off very easily and had was not seated into the cavity. Potentially, it could have been due to not positioning the matrix band well and I think I just need to get used to not being in a complete comfortable position to achieve the a good seal in this case (lots of fingers in pt's mouth, gag reflex of pt, things to consider) Ended up free handing the restoration but overhangs were thus present and was VERY difficult to polish down due to the curvature of the tooth. Was able to polish with slow speed white stone bur. Attempt to use the matrix band again to prevent such a big overhang but free handing is another option. 
DDS informed me that I said ""ohhh thats bad"" when I took off the matrix band for the first time. So just be mindful of what you're saying (keep it inside the brain).  I didn't realise I said it. 

Debridement Q2, Q3 - Hep B pt
Just reminders of  infection control. Was more mindful of aerosols and sharps for myself and my assisting operator. I should be treating every pt like this just as a precaution so this was a good reminder. I found my hand was quite tight when debriding so just remember to stretch out frequently and to have a good fulcrum and pen grasp when debriding. Figuring out what could be tooth anatomy or calc was also brought to my attention as well. This pt had bumps on the tooth that did not feel like calc (sandy/ grainy) but it was not smooth. Could it be due to medications? 
Noticed that most of the DDS do not know how or what the 11/12 explorer is... Does this mean us as OHTs should inform them that its a tool that can be used for debridement?? (was told by DDS that ""its too flimsy"" and ""doesn't get anything off"" but that is not the job of the 11/12 explorer. This has happened for the past 3 DDS students) Even if they don't decide to use it, as a collaborative effort between OHTs and Dentists, isn't it good  that there is something that OHTs can teach something they specialise in and allow the dental students to improve and expand their debridement skills and tool box? Noticed similar things towards the 4R/4L. 
Also noticed multiple times there is not an 11/12 gracey curette in the kits. Mesials tended to have more residual calc as a result. Sometimes you have to just work with the tools that is available but need to do so in a safe manner. But this can only  done by clinicians that understand the parts and sharp/ safe angles of each instrument. Doing a final round of EMS after hand debridement was particularly helpful to flush out debris and blood to do a final check.
","working on the DB surface of the most posterior tooth in the upper arch can be really difficult and fiddly, esp if they have small mouths. try to persevere with using a matrix a sit is very difficult to remove overhangs in this area. Artery forceps can help you manipulate the matrix into the correct position.

What I did well: Exam and PA was done well, due to the complexity of the pt's 5 surface resto - this required my DDS partner to take over. I took the initiative to practice what was in my scope, including LA and rubber dam placement. Management pt's fear of needles and ensured they felt comfortable. Making some jokes, always helps. 

What I could improve on: First administration of LA was not successful this could be due to the insertion point. However, second attempt was a lot better - and could feel the resistance during insertion. 

Pt 2: Restorations of the 23 MIBP, 27O + 21 MID 

What I did well: LA and caries removal was good, being identify how extensive the decay is and to do selective caries removal was important for this pt case. Resto placement was good and so was the polishing. Unfortunately during the appt, their 21 pin retained resto fell off, and Dr Scott came to help restore it. 

What I could improve on: Time management could be a lot better and ergonomics as the pt could not be seated too low, thus had to complete it from different clock positions. 23 MIBP resto was completed using a tofflemire which I had a bit of struggle placing - will need to continue practicing with tofflemire ! A lot better with the mylar strip but it does take a little bit longer. 

Pt 3: Exam + Debridement 

What I did well: General exam was good, patient communication and rapport was improving too. Pt was very reciprocative to advice and seems motivated. Debridement was good but required using the scalers - which I feel pretty good using. 

What I could improve on:  Communication with BWs - pt was not compliant and did not want to take them due to the film being sharp. Will learn more tricks to make it more comfortable for pt.

 On examination, 35 was decoronated and only root stump remaining. Patient was upset that the bridge could not be recemented and he would not be able to eat.
The difficult part about this appointment was the communication barrier. It was difficult to confirm if the patient fully understood the treatment options. Through this experience I continue to learn that treatment options, wait times and cost may not always meet the patient’s expectations. The best I can do when presented with these types of appointments is to be sympathetic and clear about what they can expect, and I may not always be able to deliver the exact outcome the patient desires.  

The second patient required a 34B restoration. I continue to try different burs and found the shofu bur a good one to polish with in this case. The 34 restoration was efficient and successful, no voids or deficiencies. 
","Time management - you need to keep on top of your notes, they should be completed before you bring in your next patient. If you leave it until later, you are more likely to omit important parts of the treatment which could impede provision of optimal Tx at subsequent appointments.
Your bridge patient was very difficult to communicate with, even with an Arbic speaking assistant in the room the whole time. Well done for taking the time to ensure the patient fully understood and consented to the proposed treatment plan.
Slow speed burs are the best for removing coronal GP.

patient 2: S/C, perio chart - completed the perio chart fairly quickly and was able to complete quadrant 1 debridement using the cavitron. had some discussions with the pt regarding NCL and decided on restoring the buccal surface of their anterior teeth
patient 3: OPG, BWs - took BWs to diagnose caries due to shadowing present on numerous teeth, surprisingly there was no radiolucency on the BWs taken. the shadowing was quite apparent so I was unsure what was occurring but decided to continue monitoring it as the pt also reported no pain or sensitivity from those teeth
patient 4: exam - pt showed up 15 minutes late but was still able to complete the exam. the pt reported pain from their wisdoms so discussions for a referral to the dental hospital were had but these conversations were quite brief and could have been longer (felt rushed to complete the exam and these conversations due to them coming in later)
patient 5: S/C, duraphat - used hand instrumentation but to remove the staining, we could have ideally used the cavitron from the start. recommended the pt have fissure sealants placed and explained the process with the pt's mother - the pt's mother was wondering abt the duration of the appt and how long it takes -> emphasised how fissure sealants are placed and the difference between fillings and a fissure sealant. pt mother understood that normal fillings required drilling whereas fissure sealants did not
patient 6: seps - wasn't able to place the seps into the mesial of the 64 due to a lack of contact (the supervisor was also unable to place it). required the supervisor to place the distal band - was unable to floss it through tight enough and required the supervisor to step in. upon reflection, it requires a fair amount of tension to be able to floss the seps through but I ideally should have been able to place the seps in myself without the supervisor stepping in.

Learned about some specific bird today for polishment  around the gum-line for buccal resto’s 
Photic material was quite hard to use compared to composite in the buccal region. Time management needs to improve with this material, otherwise everything was quite well managed

BW taking - keep the patient’s chin elevated and retract the cheek as you are placing the x-ray in the mouth, then slide the film down between the tongue and the teeth. The tube should be parallel to the long rod of the BW holder and the short perpendicular rod should overlie the radius of the tube.

First patient came in for her third emergency appointment presenting with pain on LHS. I assisted the patient when she came in for her first appointment so I had a bit of an idea of what she presented with. She presented with unknown pain that bothers her at night for the past few weeks. While the previous demonstrator indicated that the top tooth that was causing pain needed to be taken out, my demonstrator today indicated to restore carious lesions on the posterior LHS before moving on to more invasive treatment to eliminate other causes. Ended up doing 38O restoration today with resin composite. Biggest challenge was moisture control. Had to use a combination of suction and cotton rolls to keep the 38O dry. I decided not to break the distal wall while drilling as well to allow for better moisture control. Will be interesting to follow up with what treatment resolves the pain.

Patient 2
Came in for 32M and D restoration. When drilling the cavity prep, the mesial caries connected to the distal caries and extended all the way to the pulpal floor. This made the prognosis of the tooth poor. Biggest challenge was communication as the wife expressed frustration with the number of appointments required for getting dental clearance and starting denture construction. Had to provide clarity with the number of appointments before the patient can start denture construction. This seemed to ease the patient and his wife a lot more.

2) discussed radiographs (R1-5), finding caries in bite wing, and pros and cons of doing exploratory drilling to locate interproximal caries (radiograph suggest possible caries at mesiogengival and we can see discoloration on medial through buccal view, but no cavitation detected by explorer) - is tooth already compromised when caries present.
3) removal of caries near pulp - have to warn patient about risk of pulp exposure and how to manage it. Discussed about complete caries removal vs leaving discolored but firm tissue - risk of infections due to dentine tubules, and use of calcium hydroxide for management.

Saw a patient with ""white patches"" on RHS lateral border of tongue, referral said white lesions. The white patches were wipeable and hence are likely to be candidosis. Candidosis is caused by fungal infection and, therefore, should be treated with prescription of anti-fungal medications.

(basically very severe ECC where all teeth had caries to the pulp) Pt currently 5yo with 72-82 and 16, 46. Worked a lot on behavioural management as the child was initially very scared of the dentist but opened up quickly as I began talking to her. Pt was very unsettled in the chair and was talking A LOT (maybe undiagnosed ADD?). Was able to take RHS BW after lots of talking with pt (bargaining etc). Applied FM duraphat, explained effect and pros of fluoride in daily life ie TP.

2nd pt: First time seeing pt with lingual tori. 32D caries, completed resto (523- distal, lingual, buccal) without LA. First time seeing pulp chamber vertically. There was still a thin layer of dentine but it was kind of surreal seeing it. No pulp exposure but applied dycal just in case. Filling was done well, used clear strip and wedge to get smooth margins, pt was happy with aesthetics and checked with floss, was cleansable. 

3rd pt: 'Emergency' pt, came in for filling because of 'cracked tooth'. Was just a 11 chip, but near mesial cervical margin, there was unsat resto, so removed a bit of the resto and re did it with retraction cord. Did LA buccal infil and some interpapillary infils. Fun fact, pt had the same birthday as me! Also removed overhang between 11 and 21 with soflex disk. Pt happy with outcome and aesthetics! Was also cleansable after removing overhang. 

4th pt: Massive 36DLBO fractured filling from punch in the face. First time doing cuspal coverage. The resto turned out really well. Was difficult to get tofflemire in, so had to break the distal to allow for it to go in. Finished and polished, marginal wall was not too high which is great, because in sim, I usually accidentally build it very high. Build distal wall, then buccal and lingual wall. Then 2mm increments with cuspal coverage for occlusal. Pt was happy with outcome and aesthetics. Polished but demo did a bit more. 

Overall, very productive day, did many fillings, happy with my work with all of them! ","overall a good reflection- needed assistance with overhang removal and breaking contact. Maybe student was slightly apprehensive about being more invasive, but sometimes it needs to be done.

My second patient today presented with a painful, tender tooth. Clinically, this tooth was sound but there was significant generalized staining, poor perio health, and the pt had compromised overall health (Diabetes and long-term heavy smoking). I used multiple tools: a pulp sensibility test, radiographs, articulating paper, and percussion. Initially I felt overwhelmed because I could identify multiple potential causes for discomfort, but I also could not pinpoint which one was responsible for the sharp pain my patient was experiencing. The diagnostic tools added to my confusion instead of helping me narrow it down. 

In these situations, I learned I need to take a step back and take a deep breath. I also realized that the cause for pain can be (and often is) multifactorial. As a result, there are multiple potential treatment options which can work in tandem to alleviate discomfort. My provisional diagnosis was: Occlusal trauma causing reversible pulpitis. I explained to the patient my thinking: That I think there are a few different things contributing to her pain and I would like to use multiple tools to alleviate her discomfort starting from least invasive to most invasive. I tried to impress upon my patient why I was taking things one step at a time as opposed to jumping into a restoration.

Happy with denture delivery and adjustments chair side and so was the patient. When restoring the two posterior abfraction lesions, I found it difficult to maintain the lingual margins smooth and free deficiency, so the appointment ran longer than anticipated, so learnings from today: mylar strip can be very beneficial, but can create a big ledge around the opposite side if it is a long tooth like today’s patient with heavy recession. I took sometime attempting to smoothen the margins with flame burs but should have (and I eventually used) polishing strips to achieve a ledge free margin and round out the restoration around the root of the tooth. Would have saved me a lot of time if I have used the polishing strips to start so lessons learnt from that. 

With regards to second patient, was just an exo of retained roots of 32. Pt was seen by dentist in surgery next door so did not complete limited exam or further special investigations, however pt had dementia and carer was there to help translate. I made the mistake of leaving the pt behind early on in the appointment (to get instruments) as pt was already nervous. Lessons learnt from that to attend to pt first, and get DA or supervisor to help with grabbing instruments. Other wise exo was un-eventful.

The tooth was rotated and the tooth behind was an implant so I had some difficulty placing the dental dam as the patient did not want the clamp placed on the implant. I was also quite apprehensive about removing all the restoration due to how close it was to the pulp, but eventually removed all the previous resin composite. Due to the rotation of the tooth placing a V3 wasn't possible to I had to use a Tofflemire, which resulted in minimal contact mesially and I would have liked a tighter contact. I have never used the sandwich technique, using GIC as a base or liner and then resin composite over the top but I found it quite effective and will use it in the future for large restorations like this one. I chose A3 however A3.5 would have matched better however the patient did not seem concerned with the slight mismatch. Next time I would like to have a better idea of my preparation before I start - difficult as there was a crack hence the restoration ended up needing to extend distally.

The lost filling for the second patient ran smoothly. There was some difficulty with packing the resin composite at the start as it continued to stick to the ball burnisher.

The extraction was performed by the demonstrator, alongside simple interrupted suturing. Continuing to study extraction techniques will prove beneficial in efficiency of extractions.

Remember to listen to pt's complaints because that is the key for what to do for that appt during emergencies. Pt's primary concern was very much not clear. Story seemed to change from time to time and pain in the story was not consistent (things that were initially ""painful"" were not actually painful and vice versa.)

32 SDF restoration w/ photac 
Why photac? --> less prone to dissolving/ degrading over time. Fujis tend to erode. Photac is not great for occlusal restorations as its not as strong to occluding forces. not occluding surfaces are great though. absorption/ retainment and release of silver may be impeded by the rein filaments, however more research needs to be done on this. Does not need any conditioning or varnish or bond but riva bond can be used to help with any voids by filling the area a bit more and allowing photac to be easier to manipulate as photac is very sticky. Is to be used in 2mm increments (as opposed to composite where it has to be no less than 2 mm to retain)
","especially with patients that have a language barrier, practice active listening to ensure that you are both on the same page. Photacfil is resin modified GIC so it is not as wear resistant, but it is also not as soluable, so is less likely to erosode. avoid using photacfil on occlusal surfaces, but they are great for buccal, mesial and distal cavities.",Michelle Petterson,F_3Dunemi9I1Fd8El,signature.png,7024,image/png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pt 2: this was a SC. However, this patient was dentally anxious and also had poor oral hygiene which resulted in calculus removal taking more time than I had expected.

Especially since I have completed one Oral Med referral from DTC, it was cool to actually see the inner workings of this department.
The first patient was a 19 year old who previously had a tongue piercing but it got infected and has caused an overgrowth. It was refreshing to observe a patient similar to my age as I usually see older patients in DTC. The diagnosis was a fibroepithelial polyp with stem attaching it to the tongue. It caused little to no pain to the pain and impacting speech slightly. It was the first time I saw a clinician use LA for the tongue which was interesting and made me think about what clinical considerations there would be on the tongue rather than the gingiva where there is bone. The clinician removed the lesion with a sharp instrument so smoothly that the patient did not even notice! 
The second patient was a review of lesions located in sextant 3. The clinician allowed me to glove up and inspect the site in a closer view which was amazing to see. Observing lesions (e.g. fibroma) in person has been much more valuable to my learning than the clinical photographs I see on the lecture presentations from the Oral Med subject last year.
I also had a meaningful conversation with an OHT within the department and we discussed the OHT role within Oral Med. Often, the patient's first time in the dental chair is with us so it is crucial we screen them thoroughly to detect any abnormalities. There was some communication complexities with one of the patients the OHT saw as the patient really wanted to continue to be seen in the perio department despite having a stable condition. It was great to see how the clinician was able to shift the conversation to empower and reassure the patient so they could understand their perspective despite their worries.

I did not expect to stay the whole 3 hours of this observation and constantly still be engaged with what was surrounding me. Hopefully I would like to become more better at detecting lesions and making presumptive diagnoses.





","Liz was actively engaged in her learning in today's session. I find the last line of her reflection so funny because I am not sure what she was expecting but we always try to keep our students engaged. Liz got to see a lot of different patients and then was able to also observe me working. I quizzed her about OLP and bullous pemphigoid and discussed the OHT role in management and cancer prevention as well. Recommend doing further reading and study and always welcome to come back and work with us in OMed.

Liz also stepped up and helped with the clean up of bay when we were under pressure between appointments.","Clare McNally ",F_1i4LWF0DarOf4tU,signature.png,8049,image/png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient presented with pain symptoms that were not particularly indicative of any specific condition. Furthermore, the clinical and radiographic findings were not particularly clear and congruent. Additionally, there were several complicating factors, including a recent exo, periodontal disease, sensitivity however no caries was noted. For this patient, differentials included dry socket, periodontal disease and dentine hypersensitivity due to fluorosis. A multi-prong approach was adopted to address each cause, however no certainty for the exact root of the pain was determined. For these cases, I've learned that addressing potential causes, then reviewing the patient in 1/52 may be the best approach as the exact cause is unclear. However, the importance of reassuring the patient and ensuring they feel that we are taking their pain seriously even when we're not aware of the exact cause was very evident as the patient seemed quite grateful of what we did do (even though I felt like we didn't do that much). This also stressed that sometimes conservative management can be just as effective as surgical management.

A patient today also mentioned the use of clove to prevent tooth pain. This tied nicely into my research topic on cultural competency. I used this as an opportunity to ask the patient how it's prepared, how it's used and how effective it was. I also had the chance to search this up afterwards, and realised that clove oil is another name for eugenol, which is commonly used in dentistry, for instance in alveogyl and as a sedative dressing due to its analgesic and antiobacterial properties. This made me appreciate the knowledge in other cultures and how they often form the foundations for evidence-based dentistry.

When doing TTP, do not just do it on the area the patient says. So pt said she was feeling pain in Q3 due to ""wisdom teeth."" There was no wisdom teeth, but according to the TTP, it indicated that it was TMD issue. I only did TTP on Q3, however, when the supervisor came, he did on all quadrants and found out that both Q2 and 3 have positive TTP. This indicated patient has LHS TMD issues. Next time, I will make sure to do a different quadrant. Overall went good 

Patient 2 - Q2 SC/C with LA 
THERE WAS NO CALCULUS LEFT WHEN SUPERVISOR CHECKED!!! For the first time, there has been no calculus left. There was a lot of supra and subgingival calc, therefore took a long time, however, by my level, I should be faster. Also, again for the LA. Keep it away from patients side. Do not move it to much when you holding it. Retract the cheek much harder to get good retraction. Improve communication skills when it comes to LA. Practice it by playing a scenario with my brothers. Inform patient you are doing LA, she will feel a little squeeze, we are half way done, couple of more seconds, etc. 

Patient 3 - EXAM 
I missed some composite restorations. They were on the occlusal and buccal of multiple teeth, also on the palatal root surface. For the root composite, look at the neighbouring teeth and compare the colour. Composite would be more white while the root will be more yellow due to dentine exposure. For occlusal an buccal, make sure to dry well and use sickle probe to check for a catch. ","Patient 1. 
Relatively difficult diagnosis. Combination of suspected TMD + Unerupted wisdom tooth pain. Exam was done well otherwise. Bitewings  technique excellent. Pt management good.

Patient2.
LA technique needs consolidation. Recommended developing a routine and dialogue such that each time it is done, it is consistent and smoother. However the actual injection of lignocaine was done at a good pace and patient felt comfortable. S/C + SRD - very good, nil discernable calculus/plaque left. 

Patient 3:
Overall exam was done well - some difficulty in identifying small composites and differentiating some well colour matched and shaped composites. This will come with time and experience.

Pt was distressed during appt and claims that she is going to lose her teeth, however it is important to manage pt's expectations appropriately and during our attempts to reassure her, we should not state that everything is going to be fine.

Also considering if teeth are rotated to chart correctly and removing plaque from teeth using sickle/etc to be able to see occlusal surface/better assess tooth.

Originally I was looking forward to doing it as I might have a chance to take a clinical photograph of their teeth as I haven't had much experience with taking clinical photos. However, the pt was edentulous so no photos were needed. I assessed their extra and intra oral soft tissues quickly and then assessed their Upper and lower full dentures. The dentures were both loose fitting, but the lower denture was extremely bad. This was due to the very thin alveolar ridge that the pt had left. The upper denture still fit alright, but the retention could have been made better. After consulting with my supervisor we decided to make her a priority pt (because she is undergoing chemotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma). Denture OHI and diet was given to her before I dismissed the pt. This was a relatively straightforward appt. Learning that pt's who are currently receiving cancer treatments like chemotherapy can be prioritised was something that I didn't know before.

(patient 2) 3pt of the day was also a H&S pt, I examined them again as the other H&S pt was done very quickly. This pt had severe dental anxiety and wouldn't tolerate any instruments in her mouth, I was barely able to get the mirror for a few seconds without her gagging (due to fear and nausea). The pt also did not want to lie down so I had to do the exam with her sitting upright, which was very uncomfortable for me. I did the best that I could for my limited exam (E/O and I/O soft tissues, occlusion, odontogram. No BPE)before we got the pt to take an OPG to assess their dental status. For this pt, because of her dental anxiety I tried my best to be empathetic and made sure that I didn't do anything that would make her extremely uncomfortable. I spoke to her as calmly as I could and did my best to ensure that the instruments I was putting in her were safe and not going to harm her (by showing her the instruments and explaining what I was going to do with them). I think the pt responded well to my advanced because she let me examine her (only with mirror) with multiple breaks in between the checks. I had a vomit bag prepared for the pt too as she looked like she was about to vomit every few seconds. The appt went fairly smoothly and the pt was informed that they would be placed onto general COC (and also have a higher priority due to them being on chemotherapy in the past, currently on hold) as they needed to have a proper Comprehensive exam completed. I think I will try to continue my patient-practitioner rapport building to make my future patients feel even safer when they are in the chair with me.

(patient 3) 5th pt of the day was a pt I saw before for a restoration, today I completed another restoration for them. I did a 24B (cervical restoration), the lesion was fairly shallow so I did complete caries removal. At one point when I reached the dentine, I noticed that it had 2 different colours (orange and yellow) I knew the yellow was healthy dentine, however, the orange dentine wasn't something that I usually see so I got my demonstrator to double check it, turns out that if orange-ish dentine can be removed by the spoon excavator it still contains caries. After removing it, I was able to see the difference a lot better. 
The restoration went well and the polishing after was also completed nicely I was able to make sure that there were no overhangs where the gingival margin was and the shade matching was also fairly accurate (A3 used). This patient was also the first patient I ever used the gingival retraction cord on. I didn't use hemodent as the pt was a smoker so bleeding was very minimal it only occurred for a little bit after the cord was removed. I had watched other students place the retraction cord in before, so I was able to insert the cord nicely without any difficulty (size 00).","good filling on buccal surface, exam and pt management for a very anxious pt",Lvl 4: Student can be trusted to perform this task independently,No,,aarti jaitlee,F_2ScrqKtOkLqlF3V,signature.png,12646,image/png

For the first patient I took 11PA, took clinical photo of 11 periapical lesion, TTP, CO2 test and oral hygiene review. This patient was seen by DTC in 2019 and each time she was seen, the clinician stressed OH with her for the management of perio. Yet she still only brushes once a day and not flossing regularly. Today I reinforced how plaque and calc comes back 24 hours after a professional clean. I also informed her that there is a high chance that her other teeth may become wobbly if she is not up-to-date with home OH. The patient seemed like she finally understood and said she will be doing this from now on. I referred her to DDS because I found 11 and 21 cold test negative, and 11 TTP+. Along with the clinical photo which shows a draining abcess, I was able to deduce that the pulp was non-vital, and there may be a chronic periapical abcess. Unfortunately the patient does not speak English and her grandson helped translating. This patient is coming back for FM SRD in multiple sessions. Im going to take OPG and refer to perio for her Grade 1/2 mobility 12-22 further management.
The second patient is doing well with home OH. However there is still calc build up sextant 5 lingual, while her 31, 41 are implants. Theres no PD in 31, 41, but 15M implant had 4mm. Previously she was referred to fix pros and the diagnosis was implantitis. However her perio referral never went through.

It relied on my interpersonal skills and clearing out any communication that she may have had with previous appointments with DTC and Specialist clinic.

The 3rd patient I saw had cracked tooth syndrome but also signs of dentine hypersensitivity. The treatment plan I devised with the demonstrator involved moving from the least invasive to most invasive option and was therefore quite complex in nature. It was a challenge for me to communicate this with the patient, and to walk them through each step of the treatment plan with them so that they are on the same page on the different paths we can take in their care. The 4th patient was complicated as she was very stubborn and had difficulty understanding some English. As a result, it was important that I used plain English and made sure the patient understood what the options are and what the consequences of her treatment choices would be. 

Overall I feel like I performed adequately, but still was made aware of areas I should focus on in future.

The pt was initially going to have an appointment with a PC dentist, however whilst on his way to RDHM was told his appointment was cancelled, and was offered to see a student. His preference is not to see a student but obliged. It was the first time engaging a phone interpreter as there is no Nepali interpreter in the hospital, which slowed down procedures.

Considering the pts medication list and past medical history in the hospital it can be inferred that the pt did not reveal all aspects of their medical history, being mental health.

Using mouthrinse as an adjunct instead of flossing for ease in the short term until the patient shows compliance. Learn recommended products for high risk patients.

2: Learn to differentiate between primary and permanent teeth. Primary teeth are milky white and often mobile and smaller in appearance. Use eruption dates to guide differentiation. 
3: When reviewing the OPG, look for impacted teeth, especially for pts with primary dentition.  if the tooth is unable to erupt safely it may become ankilosis. Compare the tooth to the opposing sides to distinguish defects. 
4: Always ask follow-up questions regarding medications, especially if medications have contraindications such as prolia. Ask questions about dosage and frequency. 
5: Remember to change bitewing settings for children.

Highly dentally anxious patient on many medications. Was able to complete limited oral exam and the required investigations.

Patient came in for SRD for generalised periodontal disease. It was his first dental appointment in a while and he wanted to replace his upper two front teeth. Discussed with patient about his future treatment plan, i.e., removal of upper front teeth and replacement with denture, which was the most cost effective option.

I completed a 23M and 23D restoration on the pt. The pt had really heavy calc and plaque on all their teeth so I had to clean the tooth I was working and the adjacent teeth just so I could gain access to  the caries and see what I was doing. The 23M prep went a lot deeper than I had originally planned for as I was able to see a faint shadow of the pulp chamber at the end. I did a liner to protect the pulp and then restored it like usual. This restoration was done fairly well. Since there was no adjacent tooth to the 23M it was a lot easier to polish. The 23D was harder to prep as the caries was quite small and I was also afraid of hitting the adjacent tooth by accident. In the end I was able to prep it decently before restoring the tooth. Polishing the 23D was quite hard as there was quite a bit of overhang for this resto and the pt kept moving their tongue when breathing. I had to do my best to control my hand pieces to ensure that I did not accidently cut the adjacent teeth/ other surfaces of the tooh when polishing because their tongue kept pushing my bur and handpiece at random unexpected times. I got my supervisor to help with finishing off the 23D polishing as there was just a very small overhand at the gingival margin that I couldn't get rid off. I think with more practice I will be able to control my handpieces better even if the pt's tongue is getting in my way.

(patient 2) 3rd pt of the day was an emergency pt. Their PC was about pain in Q1 where their molars where. After doing the limited exam, TP, TTP, PA and perioprobing I came to some differential diagnoses as we were unable to get definitive results. The Differential diagnoses I had for the 17/18 were asymptomatic irreversible pulpitis with symptomatic apical periodontitis or pulp necrosis with symptomatic apical periodontitis or Localised Periodontitis Grade 2 stage B. The pt was informed of options such as RCT, Exo if the diagnoses were correct but since it was uncertain we did a localised debridement on the pt to help alleviate some pain as they had calculus in that area. The pt was encourage to book an appt with RDHM as they are not on the WL anymore as they would be able to conduct more tests there and give them a definitive diagnosis and treat them there. Overall I think this appt was also done alright. I finished on time and was able to provide some diagnoses for the pt's condition.","rubber dam would be gold standard  - but do need to factor in pt's level of anxiety and ability to breath thru nose.

I planned for 012, 141 and a FM SC/C originally but ended up spending most of the session doing OHI. I could have done better by fitting a FM debridement in the session, which I need improvement on. The pt has poor OH, as the last time he brushed was over a week ago. I had to explain again the aetiology of periodontal disease to ensure he understood the risks of lacking OH behaviours. In the end he understood and told us that he will start by brushing at least once a day. A toothbrush and flossettes were provided to prompt future OH behaviours. He has had ""white patches"" non-wipeable lesions on his bilateral buccal mucosa and lateral borders of the tongue. In appearance, it looked like the thickening of the epithelium, and it was not tender when I scratched them with the back of the tweezers. Followed up his OM appt by taking him to L1 at the end. My goal is to ensure he can become up-to-date with home oral hygiene rather than providing him with numerous cleans, as I'd be doing nothing if he was not motivated to take good care of his teeth. Next appt I'm doing plaque disclosing and FM SC/C, and hopefully, I will be able to see changes to OH. I will also follow up his appts with DDS and OM. If it had not improved, I will inform him of the impact of poor OH in increasing potential malignancy in oral lesions.

Consider completing a BPE prior to commencing a full perio chart. In this particular case, there wasn't any signs of periodontal disease and the patient had no pocketing over 3mm. Although, still useful information from the periodontal chart, we could have utilised time better by completing a BPE then starting some debridement. Be wary of your posture too - shouldn't have to lean too much if you have ergonomic loupes on

A patient had an erupting ""wisdom tooth"" but after further investigation, we realized it was an erupting 7, not an 8. And the patient had a retained deciduous 5; which means that they would benefit from an OPG to identify any other abnormalities. By being more comprehensive in the assessment, the treatment options changed drastically (management of a 8 is very different than a 7). It also emphasized that patient age and dental age can be different. For example, the patient age of 15 was late for erupting 7's, but too early for erupting 8's. 

Additionally, I learned about Dr. Michael's philosophy: Patients don't remember what you do for them, but they remember how you make them feel. In the patient's case today, I had to consider whether it would be better to leave the tooth alone or to debride to relieve discomfort. Since the issue is self-limiting, I may subject the patient to additional and unnecessary pain by debriding. However, debridement may make the patient feel like we have ""done something"" for them as opposed to sitting idle. I had to weigh these options, the patient's needs, and their expectations when managing them. In hindsight, it may be have been more appropriate to leave the tooth alone and send the patient home with instructions about managing. this would have saved them from the pain associated with debridement.
