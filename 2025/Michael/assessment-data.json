It was a very informative session as we got hands on experience on how to apply and indicate plaque from our clinical educator. Using the plaque gel was a little daunting at first, but with guidance and a prior debrief with our whole team helped streamline the process. Next, working with the prophy paste was a completely new experience that ran smoothly as well. Finding the right pressure for the slow speed was new at first but with practice and guidance it all worked out in the end. Overall, I think I need to improve on my confidence with the slow speed and how to smoothly angle it to maximise my efficiency in targeting areas of the tooth for plaque removal. Great informative session."}, "supervisor_data": {"time_mgmt": "3", "entrustment": "3", "communication": "2", "professionalism": "2", "assessor_013_MC1": "Not Reviewed", "assessor_013_MC2": "Not Reviewed", "assessor_013_MC3": "Not Reviewed", "assessor_013_MC4": "Not Reviewed", "assessor_013_MC5": "Not Reviewed", "assessor_013_MC6": "Not Reviewed", "assessor_013_MC7": "Not Reviewed", "assessor_013_MC8": "Not Reviewed", "assessor_111_MC1": "Yes", "assessor_111_MC2": "Yes", "assessor_111_MC3": "Yes", "assessor_111_MC4": "Yes", "assessor_111_MC5": "Yes", "assessor_111_MC6": "Yes", "assessor_111_MC7": "Yes", "assessor_111_MC8": "Yes", "assessor_feedback": "Able to apply plaque indices and charting displayed.

With regards to my cavity prep, I underestimated the extent of the caries distally, so I ended up removing too much caries towards the distal aspect, for the future, I should prioritize making an outline to ensure full extent of caries is reached. There was also a tiny spot of DEJ caries left mesio-palatally, so I should be mindful of that. In terms of my dam, I need to ensure to fully stretch the dam over the frame. Overall, on time I only finished the MO prep, thus, I could be more mindful of how quick I am going, to ensure all required procedural steps for the day are complete. Overall a very informative session, and fantastic help and feedback from Dr. Wylie (especially with tip to use the highspeed to get rid of the caries along the mesial-palatal DEJ).

After some trial and error as well as feedback from Dr Van, I found that using suction alone provided the most information as asking the patient to rinse led to too much of the disclosing gel disappearing. \r\n\r\nSomething I am proud of today is my time management. I ensured that I tracked the time I was spending on each procedure, ensuring I factored in time for my demo to come around and check my work.
